NAME
     RandomPlugin - set the seed of the internal random number generator

SYNOPSIS
     /Mokka/init/registerPlugin RandomPlugin

     /Mokka/randomSeed [SEED]

DESCRIPTION
     RandomPlugin adds a command to the Mokka user interface which lets the
     user change the seed of the internal random number generator. You may use
     this command to make sure that two Mokka jobs which run on the same input
     file will create different, statistically independent output.

     The related steering command is:

     /Mokka/init/registerPlugin RandomPlugin

          Activate RandomPlugin. If this command is missing, RandomPlugin will
          not be invoked from within the running Mokka executable at all and the
          command described below will not be available.

     The command which RandomPlugin adds to the user interface is:

     /Mokka/randomSeed [SEED]

          Set the seed of the internal random number generator to the given
          value SEED. In the current implementation of the generator, the seed
          must not be negative. The default value is zero.
          
          If you supply the value zero (or omit the parameter altogether),
          RandomPlugin will choose an arbitrary seed which is calculated from
          the Unix time and the current process ID (and therefore basically
          unpredictable).

          As with most commands in the user interface, you can display the
          current value of the seed by preceding the command with a question
          mark.

INSTALLATION
     Move the RandomPlugin directory into the subdirectory Mokka/source/Plugin
     of your Mokka installation. Add the line (here broken for display)

          EXTRALIBS += -L$(G4WORKDIR)/tmp/$(G4SYSTEM)/RandomPlugin \
                       -lRandomPlugin

     to the top part of the main makefile Mokka/source/Kernel/GNUmakefile.
     Make sure all needed environment variables (such as G4INSTALL, G4WORKDIR)
     are set up properly and run

          make

     in the directory Mokka/source to compile RandomPlugin and link it into the
     Mokka executable. Finally, add the command stated under DESCRIPTION to
     the Mokka steering file.

IMPLEMENTATION
     RandomPlugin uses the methods

          static void CLHEP::HepRandom::setTheSeed(long seed)
          static long CLHEP::HepRandom::getTheSeed(void)

     to manipulate the status of the static generator which is used by Geant4
     for the generation of uniform and gaussian random numbers.

REQUIREMENTS
     RandomPlugin needs at least Mokka release 05-02.
