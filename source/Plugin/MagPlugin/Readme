NAME
     MagPlugin - query and visualise the magnetic field

SYNOPSIS
     /Mokka/init/registerPlugin MagPlugin

     /Mokka/magnet/getMagneticField X Y Z [UNIT]
     /Mokka/magnet/showFluxLine X Y Z [UNIT]
     /Mokka/magnet/setStepLength LENGTH [UNIT]

DESCRIPTION
     MagPlugin adds several commands to the Mokka user interface which provide
     information on the configuration of the magnetic field in the detector.
     You can query the magnetic field vector at a given point in space and you
     can visualise flux lines.

     The related steering command is:

     /Mokka/init/registerPlugin MagPlugin

          Activate MagPlugin. If this command is missing, MagPlugin will not
          be invoked from within the running Mokka executable at all and the
          commands described below will not be available.

     The commands which MagPlugin adds to the user interface are:

     /Mokka/magnet/getMagneticField X Y Z [UNIT]

          Get the magnetic field vector at a given point in space. The value
          will be written to standard output. The selected point will be
          marked with a little pink dot in order to facilitate navigation in
          the geometry. The default unit is millimetres.

     /Mokka/magnet/showFluxLine X Y Z [UNIT]

          Draw the magnetic flux line which runs through a given point in
          space. The line will be shown in green and red, with the field
          vector pointing from green to red. More than one flux line can be
          shown at a time.

          The flux line will end when the field drops below a threshold of
          1E-04 Tesla, or when either the strength or the direction of the
          field show a sudden large change. (MagPlugin will assume that the
          boundary of a field region has been reached. Choose a starting
          point in another region to see the field which is defined there.)

          The default unit is millimetres.

     /Mokka/magnet/setStepLength LENGTH [UNIT]

          Choose the step length with which the calculation of the flux line
          is done. MagPlugin uses the (very simple) Euler method to follow the
          magnetic field vector step by step. The calculation will be stopped
          after a maximum of 50000 steps in each direction. Every tenth step
          point is connected with a visible line segment.

          If you want to visualise very small structures in the magnetic
          field or wish to get more exact results, you may have to decrease
          the step length. The initial value is 1 mm (corresponding to flux
          line segments of 1 cm), the default unit is millimetres.

INSTALLATION
     Move the MagPlugin directory into the subdirectory Mokka/source/Plugin
     of your Mokka installation. Add the line

          EXTRALIBS += -L$(G4WORKDIR)/tmp/$(G4SYSTEM)/MagPlugin -lMagPlugin

     to the top part of the main makefile Mokka/source/Kernel/GNUmakefile.
     Make sure all needed environment variables (such as G4INSTALL, G4WORKDIR)
     are set up properly and run

          make

     in the directory Mokka/source to compile MagPlugin and link it into the
     Mokka executable. Finally, add the command stated under DESCRIPTION to
     the Mokka steering file.

IMPLEMENTATION
     MagPlugin uses the field manager of the global detector field to query
     the field vector at any point in space. If no global detector field is
     defined, MagPlugin will display a warning message.

REQUIREMENTS
     MagPlugin needs at least Mokka release 05-02.

BUGS
     Send bug reports to Adrian Vogel <adrian.vogel@desy.de>. Be sure to
     include the word ``MagPlugin'' somewhere in the subject line.

     MagPlugin takes only the globally defined detector field into account.
     Even if further magnetic fields are attached to certain volumes and the
     queried space point lies within such a volume, the additional field will
     be ignored.

     The method of numerical integration which is used to determine the flux
     lines is very simple and will not give you exact results for the field
     distribution. A more sophisticated method of integration could in
     principle be implemented, but I think this is actually not needed.

     The density of flux lines does not indicate the field strength - it only
     depends on the starting points which you chose.
