NAME
     MaterialPlugin - print information about materials

SYNOPSIS
     /Mokka/init/registerPlugin MaterialPlugin
     /Mokka/printMaterialInfo MATERIAL
     /Mokka/printMaterialLengths

DESCRIPTION
     MaterialPlugin adds commands to the Mokka user interface which let the
     user print various kinds of information about all known G4Materials.

     The related steering command is:

     /Mokka/init/registerPlugin MaterialPlugin

          Activate MaterialPlugin. If this command is missing, MaterialPlugin
          will not be invoked from within the running Mokka executable at all
          and the commands described below will not be available.

     The commands which MaterialPlugin adds to the user interface are:

     /Mokka/printMaterialInfo MATERIAL

          Print information about a given material to standard output. The
          output contains data such as name, density, temperature, pressure,
          composition, and properties of the contributing chemical elements.

          Parameter candidates are the names of all known G4Materials plus the
          special value "all", which will cause the whole table of all known
          G4Materials to be printed. The default value is "all".

     /Mokka/printMaterialLengths

          Prints the radiation length and nuclear interaction length of all
          known G4Materials to standard output. For convenience, these values
          are also multiplied by the density of the respective material, thus
          easier to compare with listings such as in the Particle Data Book.

INSTALLATION
     Move the MaterialPlugin directory into the subdirectory Mokka/source/Plugin
     of your Mokka installation. Add the line (here broken for display reasons)

          EXTRALIBS += -L$(G4WORKDIR)/tmp/$(G4SYSTEM)/MaterialPlugin \
                       -lMaterialPlugin

     to the top part of the main makefile Mokka/source/Kernel/GNUmakefile.
     Make sure all needed environment variables (such as G4INSTALL, G4WORKDIR)
     are set up properly and run

          make

     in the directory Mokka/source to compile MaterialPlugin and link it into
     the Mokka executable. Finally, add the command stated under DESCRIPTION
     to the Mokka steering file.

IMPLEMENTATION
     The command /Mokka/printMaterialInfo does nothing but invoke the
     predefined output methods of G4Material or G4MaterialTable. Only the
     command /Mokka/printMaterialLengths iterates through the G4MaterialTable
     and creates the desired output itself.

REQUIREMENTS
     MaterialPlugin needs at least Mokka release 05-02.

BUGS
     Send bug reports to Adrian Vogel <adrian.vogel@desy.de>. Be sure to
     include the word ``MaterialPlugin'' somewhere in the subject line.

     The output of /Mokka/printMaterialInfo can sometimes be not aligned
     very neatly.

     The output of both user interface commands will usually be longer than
     80 characters per line, thus possibly not fitting onto a plain output
     device without getting ugly line wraps.
