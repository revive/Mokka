NAME
     JDoePlugin - draw a humanoid figure as a size reference

SYNOPSIS
     /Mokka/init/registerPlugin JDoePlugin

     /Mokka/jdoe/new X Y Z [UNIT]
     /Mokka/jdoe/delete
     /Mokka/jdoe/position X Y Z [UNIT]
     /Mokka/jdoe/direction ANGLE [UNIT]
     /Mokka/jdoe/colour R G B

DESCRIPTION
     JDoePlugin adds several commands to the Mokka user interface which let
     the user draw one or more simplified humanoid figures into the 3D space.
     The figure is intended as a size reference in detector visualisations. He
     (or she) is named J. Doe (John or Jane, whatever you prefer), is 1.80 m
     tall from tip to toe and consists of air. The user can choose position,
     direction of sight, and a colour.

     The related steering command is:

     /Mokka/init/registerPlugin JDoePlugin

          Activate JDoePlugin. If this command is missing, JDoePlugin will not
          be invoked from within the running Mokka executable at all and the
          commands described below will not be available.

     The commands which JDoePlugin adds to the user interface are:

     /Mokka/jdoe/new X Y Z [UNIT]

          Draw an instance of J. Doe at the given position in space. Be careful
          not to produce geometry overlaps since they might confuse some
          visualisation systems and also the Geant4 tracking. The position of
          the most recent instance can afterwards still be changed with the
          command /Mokka/jdoe/position.

          The initial values put J. Doe into a free space next to the yoke
          which is suitable for the LDC01 geometry. The default unit are
          millimetres.

     /Mokka/jdoe/delete

          Remove the most recent instance of J. Doe. If none are left, do
          nothing.

     /Mokka/jdoe/position X Y Z [UNIT]

          Change the position of the most recent instance of J. Doe. If none
          exists, the provided values will be used as default values for the
          next invocation of /Mokka/jdoe/new. Be careful not to produce
          geometry overlaps. The default unit are millimetres.

     /Mokka/jdoe/direction ANGLE [UNIT]

          Change the direction of sight of the most recent instance of J. Doe.
          If none exists, the provided value will be used for the next
          invocation of /Mokka/jdoe/new. Be careful not top produce geometry
          overlaps. The initial angle is zero, i.e. J. Doe is looking in
          z direction. The default unit are degrees.

          Only a rotation around the y-axis can be specified, therefore J. Doe
          will always stand upright with the head in positive y direction.

     /Mokka/jdoe/colour R G B

          Choose the colour in which all instances of J. Doe will be drawn. (At
          the moment it is not possible to assign individual colours to each
          single instance.) The colour is specified in terms of red, green, and
          blue, with the possible values for R, G, and B ranging from 0 to 1.
          The initial colour is red.

INSTALLATION
     Move the JDoePlugin directory into the subdirectory Mokka/source/Plugin
     of your Mokka installation. Add the line

          EXTRALIBS += -L$(G4WORKDIR)/tmp/$(G4SYSTEM)/JDoePlugin -lJDoePlugin

     to the top part of the main makefile Mokka/source/Kernel/GNUmakefile.
     Make sure all needed environment variables (such as G4INSTALL, G4WORKDIR)
     are set up properly and run

          make

     in the directory Mokka/source to compile JDoePlugin and link it into the
     Mokka executable. Finally, add the command stated under DESCRIPTION to the
     Mokka steering file.

IMPLEMENTATION
     J. Doe is placed in the detector geometry as a physical volume. You can
     have as many instances (G4PVPlacements) as you like (as long as they don't
     overlap with each other or anything else) and the changes you make to the
     geometry will be permanent.

     All instances are placed as daugher volumes of the world volume. Since
     J. Doe consists of nothing but plain air, the impact of his (or her)
     presence on Mokka's physics behaviour will be minimal.

RELATED COMMANDS
     The built-in command /vis/scene/add/scale also lets you draw a ruler-like
     object which could be used as a size reference. However, this scale does
     not give a very intuitive impression of the size of the detector.

STANDARDS
     J. Doe is exactly 1.80 m tall. This is a pretty standard body size for
     humans these days. (The imperial standard size might be six feet, which is
     approximately 1.83 m.)

REQUIREMENTS
     JDoePlugin needs at least Mokka release 05-02.

BUGS
     Send bug reports to Adrian Vogel <adrian.vogel@desy.de>. Be sure to
     include the word ``JDoePlugin'' somewhere in the subject line.

     JDoePlugin will not check for geometry overlaps when placing instances of
     J. Doe in the detector geometry. You should also keep in mind that the
     so-called world box has only a finite size (not much larger than the
     detector in most geometry models).

     All instances of J. Doe have to share the same colour. The reason for this
     is that they internally share the same logical volume and thus also the
     same visualisation attributes.

     When adding a new instance of J. Doe or changing the properties of an
     existing one, only the viewers attached to the scene handlers belonging
     to the current scene will automatically be updated. This behaviour is a
     feature of the Geant4 visualisation system.

     J. Doe will usually not look good in wireframe style (because of the
     spherical head and the tubular limbs), therefore the solid visualisation
     style is enforced. This cannot be changed via user interface commands.
