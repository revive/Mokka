NAME
     OverlapPlugin - check the geometry for volume overlaps

SYNOPSIS
     /Mokka/init/registerPlugin OverlapPlugin

     /Mokka/overlap/check [NAME]
     /Mokka/overlap/resolution RES
     /Mokka/overlap/tolerance TOL [UNIT]
     /Mokka/overlap/verbose FLAG

DESCRIPTION
     OverlapPlugin adds several commands to the Mokka user interface which let
     the user check the detector geometry for overlapping volumes and related
     geometry errors and which control the behaviour of that check.

     The related steering command is:

     /Mokka/init/registerPlugin OverlapPlugin

          Activate OverlapPlugin. If this command is missing, OverlapPlugin
          will not be invoked from within the running Mokka executable at all
          and the commands described below will not be available.

     The commands that OverlapPlugin adds to the user interface are:

     /Mokka/overlap/check [NAME]

          Run the overlap check for all physical volumes with a given NAME.
          If NAME is "all" (or omitted), all physical volumes will be checked.
          The default value is "all".

     /Mokka/overlap/resolution RES

          Set the number of points to be generated and verified for each
          volume in the overlap check. This value corresponds to the first
          argument of the function G4VPhysicalVolume::CheckOverlaps(). The
          initial value is 1000.

     /Mokka/overlap/tolerance TOL [UNIT]

          Set the maximum tolerable error distance for the overlap check. This
          value corresponds to the second argument of the built-in function
          G4VPhysicalVolume::CheckOverlaps(). The initial value is zero, the
          default unit are millimetres.

     /Mokka/overlap/verbose FLAG

          Enable or disable verbose output for the overlap check. If set to
          true, all checked volumes will be reported. If set to false, only
          error messages will be reported. This value corresponds to the third
          argument of the function G4VPhysicalVolume::CheckOverlaps(). The
          default value is true.

INSTALLATION
     Move the OverlapPlugin directory into the subdirectory
     Mokka/source/Plugin of your Mokka installation. Add the line (here broken
     for display reasons)

          EXTRALIBS += -L$(G4WORKDIR)/tmp/$(G4SYSTEM)/OverlapPlugin \
                       -lOverlapPlugin

     to the top part of the main makefile Mokka/source/Kernel/GNUmakefile
     between the linker options "-whole-archive" and "-no-whole-archive".
     Make sure all needed environment variables (such as G4INSTALL, G4WORKDIR)
     are set up properly and run

          make

     in the directory Mokka/source to compile OverlapPlugin and link it into
     the Mokka executable. Finally, add the command stated under DESCRIPTION
     to the Mokka steering file.

IMPLEMENTATION
     OverlapPlugin calls the built-in function G4VPhysicalVolume::
     CheckOverlaps() for all physical volumes that are registered in the
     G4PhysicalVolumeStore.

     Since this function is currently implemented only for the derived classes
     G4PVPlacement and G4PVParameterised, OverlapPlugin will issue a warning
     message if an object of any other derived class is encountered.

RELATED COMMANDS
     The built-in command directory /geometry/test/ also lets you run certain
     built-in geometry tests. Consult the Geant4 help system for details.

REQUIREMENTS
     OverlapPlugin needs at least Mokka release 05-02.

BUGS
     Send bug reports to Adrian Vogel <adrian.vogel@desy.de>. Be sure to
     include the word ``OverlapPlugin'' somewhere in the subject line.

     OverlapPlugin merely makes use of the built-in checking functionality of
     Geant4 - results will be no better and no worse than the Geant4 code.
