DESCRIPTION
     MarkerPlugin adds several commands to the Mokka user interface which let
     the user draw markers and rulers into the 3D space. For markers, the user
     can choose a colour, set the size, and select one of ten different shapes.
     For rulers, the user can choose a colour and set the length of a single
     step, i. e. the unit of the ruler.

     The related steering command is:

     /Mokka/init/registerPlugin MarkerPlugin

          Activate MarkerPlugin. If this command is missing, MarkerPlugin will
          not be invoked from within the running Mokka executable at all and
          the commands described below will not be available.

     The commands which MarkerPlugin adds to the user interface are:

     /Mokka/marker/put X Y Z [UNIT]

          Draw a marker with the currently selected properties at the given
          point in space. The default unit are millimetres.

     /Mokka/marker/colour R G B

          Choose the colour in which markers will be drawn. The colour is
          specified in terms of red, green, and blue, with the possible values
          for R, G, and B ranging from 0 to 1. The initial colour is red.

     /Mokka/marker/length LENGTH [UNIT]

          Set the length (measured from the centre) of the markers to be drawn.
          The default unit are millimetres, the initial size is 100 mm.

     /Mokka/marker/type MARKERTYPE

          Select the shape which markers will have. Ten different 3D shapes are
          currently available:

               0 = plus ("+" in three dimensions)
               1 = cross ("x" in three dimensions)
               2 = star (overlay of 0 and 1)
               3 = cube (wireframe)
               4 = crossed cube (overlay of 1 and 3)
               5 = octahedron (wireframe)
               6 = cuboctahedron (wireframe)
               7 = tetrahedron_1 (wireframe)
               8 = tetrahedron_2 (mirror of 7)
               9 = twin_tetrahedra (overlay of 7 and 8)

          We are currently still working on a proper 3D representation of the
          House of Santa Claus. For the time being, the initial type is 0.

     /Mokka/ruler/from X Y Z [UNIT]

          Set the point from which the ruler starts. The default unit are
          millimetres, the initial starting point is 0 0 0 mm.

     /Mokka/ruler/to X Y Z [UNIT]

          Set the point at which the ruler (approximately) ends. The default
          unit are millimetres, the initial end point is 0 0 5000 mm.

          The distance from starting point to end point will be traversed in
          steps of STEPLENGTH (see below). If the whole distance is not a
          multiple of STEPLENGTH, the ruler will be shortened accordingly.

     /Mokka/ruler/step STEPLENGTH [UNIT]

          Set the length of one unit of the ruler. The ruler will be drawn in
          steps of STEPLENGTH, with every other step being invisible. Each step
          will have a label showing the distance from the starting point of the
          ruler in units of millimetres. The default unit are millimetres, the
          initial step length is 1000 mm.

     /Mokka/ruler/colour R G B

          Choose the colour in which ruler will be drawn. The colour is
          specified in terms of red, green, and blue, with the possible values
          for R, G, and B ranging from 0 to 1. The initial colour is red.

     /Mokka/ruler/label FLAG

          Select whether the ruler should have text labels or not. The boolean
          argument FLAG acts as a switch. The initial value is true, i.e. text
          labels are shown.

     /Mokka/ruler/draw

          Draw a ruler with the currently selected settings.

INSTALLATION
     Move the MarkerPlugin directory into the subdirectory Mokka/source/Plugin
     of your Mokka installation. Add the line (here broken for display)

          EXTRALIBS += -L$(G4WORKDIR)/tmp/$(G4SYSTEM)/MarkerPlugin \
                       -lMarkerPlugin

     to the top part of the main makefile Mokka/source/Kernel/GNUmakefile.
     Make sure all needed environment variables (such as G4INSTALL, G4WORKDIR)
     are set up properly and run

          make

     in the directory Mokka/source to compile MarkerPlugin and link it into the
     Mokka executable. Finally, add the command stated under DESCRIPTION to
     the Mokka steering file.

IMPLEMENTATION
     MarkerPlugin draws transient objects into the 3D space. However, these
     objects (polylines and text) do not become part of the current scene, so
     they will disappear when the viewer is refreshed.

     As long as the viewer is not refreshed, you can have as many markers and
     rulers floating around as you like.

RELATED COMMANDS
     The built-in command /vis/scene/add/scale also lets you draw a ruler-like
     object. However, this scale does not have labels and you can only have one
     instance of it in your scene at a time.

REQUIREMENTS
     MarkerPlugin needs at least Mokka release 05-02.

BUGS
     Send bug reports to Adrian Vogel <adrian.vogel@desy.de>. Be sure to
     include the word ``MarkerPlugin'' somewhere in the subject line.

     The ruler labels are not separated from the ruler itself and thus may be
     hard to read. This is to ensure that the labels will be visible when a
     cross section (/vis/viewer/set/sectionPlane) is applied.

     Some visualisation drivers may not be able to handle the ruler labels
     properly. This can lead to runtime exceptions and the abortion of Mokka.

     With MarkerPlugin, you can clutter up your viewer beyond recognition.
