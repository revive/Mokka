NAME
     LogPlugin - write a log file

SYNOPSIS
     /Mokka/init/registerPlugin LogPlugin
     /Mokka/init/userInitString logName FILENAME
     /Mokka/init/userInitBool logClear false | true
     /Mokka/init/userInitInt logStep STEPWIDTH

DESCRIPTION
     LogPlugin writes a log file containing the date and time of Mokka startup
     and exit, the beginning and end of the simulation runs, and optionally a
     report on the progress of each run.

     The related steering commands are as follows:

     /Mokka/init/registerPlugin LogPlugin

          Activate LogPlugin. If this command is missing, LogPlugin will not
          be invoked from within the running Mokka executable at all.

     /Mokka/init/userInitString logName FILENAME

          Specify the filename of the log file. FILENAME may also contain a
          relative or an absolute path. The default is not to write any file.

     /Mokka/init/userInitBool logClear false | true

          Select whether log entries will be appended to an existing file of
          the given name (false) or whether the file will be overwritten
          (true). The default value is false.

     /Mokka/init/userInitInt logStep STEPWIDTH

          If not zero, the completion of every STEPWIDTH-th event will give a
          log entry indicating the approximate progress of the current run.
          This can be useful for monitoring a large job on a remote machine,
          for example. The default value is zero.

INSTALLATION
     Move the LogPlugin directory into the subdirectory Mokka/source/Plugin of
     your Mokka installation. Add the line

          EXTRALIBS += -L$(G4WORKDIR)/tmp/$(G4SYSTEM)/LogPlugin -lLogPlugin

     to the top part of the main makefile Mokka/source/Kernel/GNUmakefile.
     Make sure all needed environment variables (such as G4INSTALL, G4WORKDIR)
     are set up properly and run

          make

     in the directory Mokka/source to compile LogPlugin and link it into the
     Mokka executable. Finally, add the commands stated under DESCRIPTION to
     the Mokka steering file.

USER VARIABLES
     See DESCRIPTION for a list of user initialisation variables which are
     recognised by LogPlugin.

IMPLEMENTATION
     LogPlugin makes use of the BeginOfRunAction, EndOfRunAction, and
     EndOfEventAction hooks to follow the progress of each simulation run.

STANDARDS
     LogPlugin uses the ctime() function to convert the time to ASCII text
     according to the current timezone and locale.

SEE ALSO
     ctime(3)

REQUIREMENTS
     LogPlugin needs at least Mokka release 05-02.

BUGS
     Send bug reports to Adrian Vogel <adrian.vogel@desy.de>. Be sure to
     include the word ``LogPlugin'' somewhere in the subject line.

     LogPlugin does not check for I/O errors when writing its log file.
