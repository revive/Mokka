<h2>
1. The Fortran subroutine library</h2>
<a name="1.1"></a>
<h3>1.1 Subroutine CGAInit</h3>
First of all, we have to build the geometry model, the one that is used
by the simulation. This can be done by calling the cgainit subroutine:
<p>call CGAInit(steer, model, setup, host, user, passwd)
</p>
<p>The parameters of this subroutine allow access to the MySql geometry
database used by the geometry model:<br>
</p>
<p><u>steer</u>=the content of the steering file. If not present, the
empty string ("") can be passed.<br>
<u>model</u>=the model name in the geometry database. Required. <br>
<u>setup</u>=the detector setup. Can be passed the empty string ("").<br>
<u>host</u>=the host name where the geometry database is running. Can
be passed as ' ' if one wants to connect to the geometry database
running
on aldebaran.in2p3.fr.
<br>
<u>user</u>=the user name for geometry database access. Can be passed
as ' ' if one wants to log on the "consult" account on the geometry
database
running on aldebaran.in2p3.fr.
<br>
<u>passwd</u>=the user password for geometry database access. Can be
passed as ' ' which means the default password for the "consult"
account
on the geometry database running on aldebaran.in2p3.fr.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The following example shows how one could call this subroutine:
</p>
<p>CHARACTER*6 steer, model, setup, host, user, passwd
</p>
<p>steer=' '<br>
model='D08' <br>
setup=' '<br>
host=' '
<br>
user=' '
<br>
passwd=' '
<br>
call CGAInit(steer, model, setup, host, user, passwd)
</p>
<p>OR
</p>
<p>call CGAInit(' ', 'D08', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ')
</p>
<p><a name="1.2"></a></p>
<h3>1.2 Subroutine CGAWhereAmI</h3>
This subroutine gives you the name of the volume that a given point (x,
y, z) is situated in:
<p>call CGAWhereAmI(point, volname)
</p>
<p>The parameters of the subroutine are as follows:
</p>
<p><u>point</u>=the x, y, z coordinates (in centimeters) of the point.
MUST be defined REAL*8.
<br>
<u>volname</u>=the name of the volume (GEANT 4 logical volume) that
"point" is situated in. This is filled by the subroutine. If one did
not
allocate enough memory for volname, the name will be truncated.
</p>
<p>The following example shows how one could call this subroutine and
use
its return value:
</p>
<p>CHARACTER*30 volname
<br>
REAL*8 point(3)
<br>
point(1)=0
<br>
point(2)=175
<br>
point(3)=0
</p>
<p>call CGAWhereAmI(point, volname)
<br>
write(*,15) volname
<br>

</p>
<p><a name="1.3"></a></p>
<h3>1.3 Getting the information on the particle passage through the
volumes</h3>
One of the items of interest in reconstruction is to know the
distances,
or the number of X0 (the radiation length) that a particle traveled
along
in the different volumes, layers, etc. In order to get this
information,
one has first to shoot the desired particle, using the subroutine
CGABeamOn,
and then to get the information by calling the subroutine CGAGetSteps
or
the subroutine CGAGetVolumeData.
<h4><a name="1.3.1"></a></h4>
<h4>
1.3.1 Subroutine CGABeamOn</h4>
This subroutine allows one to to shoot the desired particle:
<p>call CGABeamOn(initial, final, direction, particle, energy, nbp)
</p>
<p>The parameters of this subroutine are:
</p>
<p><u>initial</u>: the coordinates (in centimeters) of the point from
where
the particle is shot. MUST be defined REAL*8.
<br>
<u>final</u>: the coordinates (in centimeters) of the final point of
the particle's trajectory. If the particle is charged, it shall be
killed
as soon as it enters the volume (layer) that the final point is
situated
in. MUST be defined REAL*8.
<br>
<u>direction</u>: the direction that the particle is shot. MUST be
defined REAL*8.
<br>
<u>particle:</u>&nbsp; the particle's name
<br>
<u>energy</u>: the particle's energy. MUST be defined REAL.
<br>
<u>nbp</u>: the number of particles that we want to shoot
</p>
<p>The following example shows how one could call this subroutine:
</p>
<p>CHARACTER*30 particle
<br>
REAL*8 initial(3), final(3), direction(3)
<br>
REAL energy
<br>
INTEGER nbp
</p>
<p>initial(1)=-68
<br>
initial(2)=169
<br>
initial(3)=0
<br>
final(1)=-200*sin(3.1418/8)
<br>
final(2)=200*cos(3.1418/8)
<br>
final(3)=0
<br>
direction(1)=final(1)-initial(1)
<br>
direction(2)=final(2)-initial(2)
<br>
direction(3)=final(3)-initial(3)
<br>
particle='geantino'
<br>
energy=20
<br>
nbp=1
</p>
<p>call CGABeamOn(initial, final, direction, particle, energy, nbp)
</p>
<p>OR
</p>
<p>call CGABeamOn(initial, final, direction, 'chargedgeantino', 20.0,
1)
<br>
<a name="1.3.2"></a></p>
<h4>1.3.2 Subroutine CGAGetSteps</h4>
One can get the information on distances, number of X0 and the entrance
point in evry volume,&nbsp; by calling the subroutine CGAGetSteps:
<p>call CGAGetSteps(volnames, matnames, distance, prepoints, nbx0,
ninterlen, nsteps,
okflag)
</p>
<p>The parameters of the subroutine are as follows:
</p>
<p><u>volnames</u>=an array of names of the volumes (GEANT 4 logical
volumes)
that the particle went through. This array is filled by the subroutine.
If one did not allocate enough memory for every name, the names will be
truncated.
<br>
<u>matnames</u>=an array of names of the materials (GEANT 4 materials)
that the particle went through. This array is filled by the subroutine.
If one did not allocate enough memory for every name, the names will be
truncated.
<u><br>
distance</u>=an array of distances that the particle went along
in each volume. This array is filled by the subroutine. MUST be defined
REAL*8.
<br>
<u>prepoints</u>=a matrix of the x, y, z coordinates of the entrance
point in evry volume. This matrix is filled by the subroutine. MUST be
defined REAL*8.
<br>
<u>nbx0</u>=an array containig the number of radiation lengths in evry
volume that
the particle went through. This array is filled by the subroutine. MUST
be defined REAL*8.<br>
<u>ninterlen</u>=an array containig the number of interaction lengths
in evry volume that
the particle went through. This array is filled by the subroutine. MUST
be defined REAL*8.<br>
<u>nsteps</u>=the number of elements/volumes:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the initial value is the number of elements
allocated
for volnames, distance, nbx0, and the number of rows allocated for
prepoints.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the value after this subroutine returns is the
real number of layers that the particle went through.
<br>
<u>okflag</u>=when this subroutine returns, it is set to true if the
initial value of nsteps is greater or equal to the number of volumes
that
the particle went through, and if not, okflag is set to false&nbsp;
Thus,
one should test okflag before trying to use the return values of the
subroutine.
If it is false, one should allocate a larger amount of elements for the
above parameters.
</p>
<p>The following example shows how one could call this subroutine and
use
its return values:
</p>
<p>CHARACTER*30 volnames(1000),&nbsp; matnames(1000)<br>
REAL*8 distance(1000), nbx0(1000), nintlen(1000), prepoints(1000, 3)
<br>
LOGICAL okflag
<br>
INTEGER nsteps
</p>
<p>okflag=.true.
<br>
nsteps=1000
</p>
<p>call CGAGetSteps(volnames, matnames, distance, prepoints, nbx0,
nintlen, nsteps,
okflag)
</p>
<p>if(okflag .eqv. .true.) then
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; do i=1,nsteps
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; write(*,12)volnames(i),
matnames(i),
distance(i), prepoints(i,1), prepoints(i,2), prepoints(i,3), nbx0(i),
nintlen(i)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; enddo

<br>
<a name="1.3.3"></a></p>
<h4>1.3.3 Subroutine CGAGetVolumeData</h4>
Suppose we were interested in getting the above information as a sum
over
the layers of a module. We can call for this purpose the subroutine
CGAGetVolumeData:
<p>call CGAGetVolumeData(volname, distance, prepoints, nbx0, ninterlen,
nsteps,
okflag)
</p>
<p>The parameters of the subroutine are as follows:
</p>
<p><u>volname</u>=the name of the (GEANT 4 logical volume) of the
module
of interest.
<br>
<u>distance</u>=an array of distances that the particle went along
in each module. This array is filled by the subroutine. MUST be defined
REAL*8.
<br>
<u>prepoints</u>=a matrix of the x, y, z coordinates of the entrance
point in evry module. This matrix is filled by the subroutine. MUST be
defined REAL*8.
<br>
<u>nbx0</u>=an array containig the number of X0 in evry module that
the particle went through. This array is filled by the subroutine. MUST
be defined REAL*8.
<br>
<u>ninterlen</u>=an array containig the number of interaction lengths
in evry volume that
the particle went through. This array is filled by the subroutine. MUST
be defined REAL*8.<br>
<u>nsteps</u>=the number of elements/modules:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the initial value is the number of elements
allocated
for distance, nbx0, and the number of rows allocated for prepoints
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the value after this subroutine returns is the
real number of modules that the particle went through.
<br>
<u>okflag</u>=when this subroutine returns, it is set to true if the
initial value of nsteps is greater or equal to the number of modules
that
the particle went through, and if not, okflag is set to false&nbsp;
Thus,
one should test okflag before trying to use the return values of the
subroutine.
If it is false, one should allocate a larger amount of elements for the
above parameters.
</p>
<p>The following example shows how one could call this subroutine and
use
its return values:
</p>
<p>CHARACTER*30 volname
<br>
REAL*8 distance(1000), nbx0(1000), nintlen(1000), prepoints(1000, 3)
<br>
LOGICAL okflag
<br>
INTEGER nsteps
</p>
<p>okflag=.true.
<br>
nsteps=1000
<br>
volname='EnvLog'
</p>
<p>call CGAGetVolumeData(volname, distance, prepoints, nbx0, nintlen,
nsteps,
okflag)
</p>
<p>if(okflag .eqv. .true.) then
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; do i=1,nsteps
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; write(*,17)volname, distance(i),
prepoints(i,1),prepoints(i,2),
prepoints(i,3), nbx0(i)

<h3>1.4 Getting the coordinates of the cell center</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cell center coordinates are calculated by the
sensitive
detector. One has to set the right sensitive detector first by calling
subroutine CGASetSD, and then call subroutine CGACellIndex to get the
cell
center coordinates. Example no. 6 shows how to get the cell center
coordinates
from an ASCII hit file written by Mokka. The rightmost column of every
line is the flag that one has to pass to CGASetSD, and the second from
right to left is the CellID that has to be passed to CGACellIIndex.
<p><a name="1.4.1"></a><br>
1.4.1 Subroutine CGASetSD
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just call this subroutine with the flag as
argument:
</p>
<p>INTEGER Flag
<br>
call CGASetSD(Flag)
</p>
<p>The subroutine selects the sensitive detector corresponding to the
flag.
</p>
<p><a name="1.4.2"></a><br>
1.4.2 Subroutine CGACellIndex
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One can call this subroutine with the CellID as
argument
and the x, y, z variables that will contain the coordinates of the cell
center as returned by the subroutine:
</p>
<p>REAL*8 x, y, z
<br>
INTEGER CellID
<br>
call CGACellIndex(CellID, x, y, z)
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;
<a name="1.5"></a><br>
</p>
<h3>1.5 Getting the CellId of a point</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CellId of a point of given coordinates is
calculated by the sensitive
detector. One has to set the right sensitive detector first by using
CGASetSD,
and then use CGAGetCellId to get the compressed cell index. <br>
<br>
NB: With the latest versions of Geant 4, one has also to shoot first a
particle, so that Geant 4 doest its initializations.<br>
<br>
<a name="1.5.1"></a><br>
<h4>1.5.1 CGAGetCellId</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One can call this function with the coordinates of
the point, a
flag that will be returned by the method to show if the point was
really inside a cell (flag = 1), inside a guard-ring (flag = 0; the
CellId will be the one of the nearest cell), or inside another volume
that is not sensitive (flag = -1 and CellId = 0), and a direction that
is
used by Geant 4 if the point is on the border of two volumina.<br>
<br>
int cellId, flag;<br>
double x = 50.0, y = 20.0, z = -15.0;<br>
double xDir = 1.0, yDir = 0.0, zDir = 1.0;<br>
CGASetSD(SDIndex);
<br>
<br>
CGAGetCellId(x, y, z, cellId, flag, xDir, yDir, zDir);<br>
<br>
if one had defined <br>
<br>
double xDir = 0.0, yDir = 0.0, zDir = 0.0;<br>
<br>
the direction would have been set by the CGA to default (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)<br>
<br>
The example Ex06.f shows the usage of this method.<br>
