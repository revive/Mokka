The Mokka/examples/CGA directory shows how one can use the CGA interface.
<p>You must do the following to get these examples running:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. One first has to build Mokka, as these examples
rely on Mokka libraries.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Then the java CGA interface should be built if
one wants to run Ex03 and Ex05.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This interface is located in the Mokka/java/CGA
directory. Just go in that directory
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and type: gmake. The result (libCGAJava.so and CGAJava.jar)
is located in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $G4WORKDIR/CGAJava/$G4SYSTEM directory.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Build the examples by typing: gmake
<p>Note: Ex04 and Ex05 use the LCIO library to read LCIO Mokka hit files.
You need to have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; installed LCIO
and built Mokka with it (you need to make the LCIO environment variable
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; point to the
home directory of LCIO for that - for example: export LCIO=$HOME/lcio/v01-00)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note
that Mokka is compatible with LCIO v01-00. Then build the java CGAinterface
and the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; examples. If
you don't set the LCIO environment variable only Ex01, Ex02 and Ex03 will
be built.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See http://www-it.desy.de/physics/projects/simsoft/lcio.
<p>Running the examples:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Ex01 and Ex02 just show how to get information
about distances or number of X0's between two
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; points in space. You run
them by just typing their names. Ex03 does the same in java. You run it
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by typing: make run-ex03.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Ex04 and Ex05 (the java version of Ex04) read
an LCIO file (default file name is recjob.slcio)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and use the CellID0 of every
hit to get the cell center coordinates. First you have to generate
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these files with Mokka.
You run Ex04 by just typing it's name, and Ex05 by typing:make run-ex05.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Ex06 does the same as Ex04 and Ex05 but with ASCII
hit files (default file name is ecal000000.hits)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generated by Mokka. You
run it by typing it's name.
