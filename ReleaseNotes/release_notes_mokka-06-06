Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.1 and CLHEP 2.0.3.2
   (but it is still compatible with previous Geant4 / CLHEP versions)
   LCIO v01-05, v01-06, v01-07, v01-08-01 or v01-09 (recommended), 
   gcc 3.2.3, gcc 3.4.5 or
   gcc 4.1.1, SL3 or SL4, optionally with Gear v00-08-02

===============================================================================
 I. Updating PhysicsListFactory

    The PhysicsListFactory can now instantiate the new physics lists that
    became available with Geant4 9.1 : FTFP_BERT, QGSC_BERT, QGSP_DIF, 
    QGSP_BERT_DIF, QGS_BIC and FTF_BIC.
    
    A macro was added to test for the Geant4 release in order to allow
    previous Geant4 releases to be used.

 II. Bug fix in RunManager class

     A fix was made in the method RunManager::RunInitialization() that is
     aimed to avoid a memory leak while repeating many times the command
     
     /run/beamOn

     The fix was also checked when running Mokka in visualization mode.


III. Geometry fixes to Cern 2007 TB models
    
    Some corrections were added to the drivers TBcatcher06 and TBmuoncount03 
    in order to remove overlaps between TCMT and Hcal when using nonzero
    configuration angles.
    A bug in the definition of the hit position in all scintillators drivers 
    have also been corrected. Now all the hits are generated in the correct
    (x,y) position.

IV. Density bug fix in TBhcal06
    
    The density of the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) material FR4 was corrected to 
    be 1.7*g/cm3 (instead of the old incorrect  value of 1.025*g/c,3). The corrected 
    value was taken from http://pcba10.ba.infn.it/temp/ddd/ma/materials/list.html.


 V. Warning for bugs with SEcal02 and its sensitive detector SEcalSD02

    The released SEcal02 driver has known bugs concerning the hits in the end caps. 
    It's not fixed, as we have to insure backward compatibility with the models using 
    it (LDC01_05Sc and LDCPrime_01Sc). Users should avoid using these models.
    

VI. New SEcal03 driver and sensitive detector SEcalSD03

    The new SEcal03 driver and its sensitive detector fix the known bugs with
    SEcal02 and SEcalSD02. Moreover, the Si cells in wafers are now forced to
    be squared. The Ecal_cells_size parameters is understood as a hint. 
    Depending on the Ecal_Barrel_halfZ, Ecal_barrel_number_of_towers, 
    Ecal_lateral_face_thickness and a lot of other parameters, the SEcal03
    driver adjust the cell size to have a integer number of identical cells
    in theta Z direction. Then, it forces the same value for the X direction.
    The same values are used for the end cap slabs.

    The new SEcal03 driver fix also another bug, which let to not propagate 
    correctly the z_begin value for the LCal01 driver.


VII. Improved FieldMap implementation in Field00

      FieldMap implementation was changed in class Field00 and thus
      the CPU time was reduced by about 2.5 - 3 %.


VIII. New Vertex Detector Geometries

   Three new Vertex Detector geometries VXD03, VXD03_sensin and VXD04 are 
   implemented in this release. These geometries are realistic and flexible 
   descritpion of : 
   	- 5 layer LDC like vertex detector (VXD03) 
	- 5 layer LDC like vertex detector with sensors placed at the bottom 
            of the support ladder (VXD03_sensin)
	- 3 double layer GLD like vertex detector (VXD04). 
   
   These three geometries are based on the ladder description for LOI decided 
   by the wordwide VTX community.  Nevertheless these geometries are very 
   flexible thanks to free parameters that can be set in the Mokka steering 
   file. 

    The user can change on fly :
      	- The radius of each layer.
		- the 5 layers can be modified for the VXD03 and the 
			VXD03_sensin geometries
		- the 3 double layers radius and the gap between paired layer 
			for the VXD04 geometry
        - The thickess, and the kind of material of the ladder support
	- The length, the width and the thickness of the silicon active part 
	- Presence or not of electronic and the end of the ladder and/or/not 
	  side band structure along the ladder
		- thickness and length of the ladder end electronic
		- thickness and width of side band structure
	- The side band structure can be swicth on as a sensituve part of the 
		detector 
	- The VXD is surounded by a cryostat or not.
   The optimal number of ladder per layer are calculated automatically when 
   radius and width of the layer are changed.
    
   The following list give the different parameters that can by modified in 
   the steering file.
   
   	Common parameters for all the VXD geometries :
   
		VXD_support_ladder_thickness   
		VXD_support_ladder_material    

		VXD_active_silicon_thickness   

		VXD_cryostat_option            

		VXD_side_band_electronics_thickness
		VXD_side_band_electronics_width
		VXD_side_band_electronics_option

		VXD_end_ladd_electronics_option
		VXD_end_ladd_electronics_half_length
		VXD_end_ladd_electronics_thickness

		VXD_active_side_band_electronics_option	 
   
   	Specific parameters for the VXD03 and VXD03_sensin:	

		VXD_width_r1  (this is the width of the silicton active part)
		VXD_width_r2
		VXD_width_r3
		VXD_width_r4
		VXD_width_r5
	
		VXD_length_r1 (this is the length of the silicon active part)
		VXD_length_r2
		VXD_length_r3
		VXD_length_r4
		VXD_length_r5
	
		VXD_inner_radius
		VXD_radius_r2
		VXD_radius_r3
		VXD_radius_r4
		VXD_outer_radius

   	Specific parameters for the VXD04 :	
    
		VXD_width_r1  (this is the width of the silicton active part)
		VXD_width_r3
		VXD_width_r5
	
		VXD_length_r1 (this is the length of the silicon active part)
		VXD_length_r3
		VXD_length_r5
	
		VXD_inner_radius
		VXD_radius_r3
		VXD_radius_r5

		VXD_layer_gap
	 
   
   Furthermore, users have to use the TUBE02 description of the beampipe 
   because the modification of the inner most layer will modified the radius 
   of the beampipe. Indeed the inner most most layer is mechanically linked to 
   the beampipe. 
   The distance of the inner most layer and the beampipe is fixed at 1 mm. The 
   use can also modified the beampipe thickness in the steering file using the 
   parameter : TUBE_central_thickness.


IX. New HCAL superdriver SHcalSc01 and new HCAL sensitive detectors

    SHcalSc01 is a new HCAL superdriver containing only the
    scintillator option. An additional gap is introduced in the middle of the staves,
    in order to get a little bit more realistic description of the detector.
    As a consequence, the HCAL layers are divided into 2 halves (in the left and right
    side of a stave). The layers have now an aluminium support. There are also 4 pointing 
    cracks in the endcaps and in the endcaps rings. The Hcal_cells_size is now by default 3.
    In the barrel, a special algorithm is applied to deal with fractional cells at the 
    edges of a layer. The algorithm is applied in the barrel's sensitive detector 
    (SDHcalBarrel) and takes care that the fractional tiles always have the size
    > Hcal_cells_size/2 and < Hcal_cells_size. The endcaps still have integer cells,
    with problems at the edges. 
    
    New parameters are introduced:
    Hcal_chamber_thickness = thickness of the HCAL chambers; default value 6.5 mm
    Hcal_layer_support_length = x-length of the HCAL layer support in the barrel;
                                default value 5 mm
    Hcal_layer_air_gap = gap between layer support and scintillator in the HCAL barrel;
                         default value 2 mm
    Hcal_middle_stave_gaps = gap in the middle of the HCAL barrel staves;
    			     default value 3 mm
    Hcal_apply_Birks_law =1 apply Birks law to the HCAL scintillator response, =0 do not
    	                  apply Birks law; default value 1.
			  This parameter is given as a parameter to the constructor of 
			  the HCAL sensitive detectors.

    New sensitive detector classes:
    - SDHcalBarrel: HCAL barrel sensitive detector, contains fractional tile algorithm
                    and applies Birks attenuation law to the energy deposition, if
		    Hcal_apply_Birks_law is 1
    - SDHcalEndcaps: HCAL endcaps and endcaps rings sensitive detector,
    		     applies Birks attenuation law to the energy deposition, if
		     Hcal_apply_Birks_law is 1
		     
    New class: the G4 class G4EmSaturation was provided by Vladimir IVANTCHENKO (CERN), 
    and it is used for the Birks law. It should come with the next GEANT4 release. Untill 
    then, we just keep a copy of it.
    
    A new encoder: Encoder32Hcal was necessary, since we needed an additional bit for
    the stave id. The stave id is now 16 instead of 8. An odd stave id (1, 3, ...) 
    indicates that we have a hit in the left half of a stave, whereas an even stave id
    (2, 4, ...) indicates a hit in the right part of a stave. The bits available for the
    layer id were also increased by 1, in the idea that somebody would like to go later
    to a larger number of HCAL layers (>64), for testing purposes.


   X. Improvement of Ecal implementation for TB Cern 2006 models

   Independent Y shifts of the 2 Si layers of each slab were implemented in the
   new driver Proto04_02. This driver is connected to 2 new DB's 
   (ProtoCern0806_02 and ProtoCern1006_02) having a new table 'si_layers' 
   that stores the Y shifts of all layers (maximum allowed shift is +/- 0.2 mm)

   Usage within a full TB model:
	/Mokka/init/detectorModel TBCern1006_01_dchxy_new
        /Mokka/init/EditGeometry/rmSubDetector ProtoCern1006_01 
        /Mokka/init/EditGeometry/addSubDetector ProtoCern1006_02

   Usage of Ecal alone:
        /Mokka/init/subDetector ProtoCern0806_02

===============================================================================

  XI. Bug fix in VTX-Gear interface
  The definition of phi0 and offset have been clarified in gear v00-08-02:
  phi0: azimuthal angle of (outward pointing) normal of first ladder in layer
  offset: shift of every ladder in the direction of increasing phi

  modified VXD01.cc,  VXD02.cc,  VXD03.cc , i.e. also older models will create a 
  slightly different gear file  (phi0 and offset) 

  ->  use gear v00-08-02 or higher for everything to be  consistent


===============================================================================

 XII. New steering command setting the MC Run Number of LCEvent

   A new steering command was added to set the Monte Carlo run number
   of every LCEvent:

   /Mokka/init/mcRunNumber

   This is different than the previously created Calice specific command:

   /Mokka/init/dataRunNumber

   that was aimed to write the number of the Test Beam run corresponding
   to the simulation run.

 
===============================================================================
 XIII. Bug fix in TrackSummary w/ SimulatorStatus - isCreatedInSimulation

    ensure that the bit LCIO::BITisCreatedInSimulation in the SimulatorStatus
    is only set if the MCParticle actually has been created in Mokka/geant4

	  
===============================================================================

 XIV. New digital Hcal implementation

     Thanks to Emmanuel Latour, a new implementation of Digital Hcal is 
     available as sub-detector SHcal04. Only barrel modules are changed,
     the EndCaps and EndCapRings are the same as in previous models.
     A detailed description can be found at:

     http://polzope.in2p3.fr:8081/MOKKA/detector-models/ldc/DHCALdoc.pdf


===============================================================================

  XV. New SilC drivers

     Thanks to Valeri Saveliev, all SI inner track devices have a new
     implementation folowing the SilC designs. It concerns the Sit, the
     Ftd, the Etd as well the first implementation for the Set device.
     It concerns the SSit02, SFtd04, SEtd01 and SSet01 super drivers
     which use the sit02, ftd01, etd01 and set01 new basic drivers.
