What is new in this Mokka release 
=================================

   I. Ecal, -z endcap hits fixed
  II. New parameters in DB for digitilization
 III. GEAR interface updates
  IV. Ecal plug (or ring around Lcal)
   V. New orientation for Ecal slabs in end caps

===============================================================================

Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.0.p01 and CLHEP 2.0.3.1
   LCIO v01-05, v01-06, v01-07, v01-08-01 or v01-09 (recommended), 
   gcc 3.2.3, gcc 3.4.5 or
   gcc 4.1.1, SL3 or SL4, optionally with Gear v00-08

===============================================================================

   I. Ecal, -z endcap hits fixed

      Before fixes, all end cap hits in Ecal were always placed in
      +Z end cap. Fixed.

  II. New parameters in DB with hints for digitilization

      Tree new parameters in Mokka DB with hints for digitilization:
      Hcal_digitization_tile_size  and TPC_pad_width. 
      These parameters have no meaning for Simulation, 
      they are just written in Gear files used by reconstruction processes.

      Note: TPC_pad_height is used in the simulation in tpc08 (TPC06.cc) 
            which creates tracker hits at the meassurement surfaces defined 
            by the pad rows
      
 III. GEAR interface updates:
      - GEAR interface added to LumiCal and LumiCalX drivers. GEAR interface
        removed from SLcal01, as that superdriver is using LumiCalX (and thus
        the LumiCalX GEAR interface).
      - SHcal03 GEAR interface extended to treat the HCAL ring properly.
        The new version of this code requires GEAR v00-08 or newer.
      - SHcal03 GEAR interface will now use Hcal_digitization_tile_size
        to describe the CellSize0 and CellSize1 parameters in the GEAR file,
        i.e. those are now 30mm by default instead of 10mm.
        The older Tesla drivers hcal02, hcal03, hcal04 do the same thing, but
        due to lack of database information about the tile size the value
        is hardcoded in SHcal01.
      - SEcal02 now produces GEAR parameters for ECAL plug (aka ECAL ring)
      - Hcal_virtual_cell_size now also provided for Hcal endcap (SHcal03,
        hcal02, hcal03, hcal04) and ring (SHcal03).

  IV. Ecal plug (or ring around Lcal)

      A new device, the Ecal plug (or the Ecal ring) is built by SEcal02. 
      It implements a squared-rounded ring around the LCal. The central
      cylinder hole follow the Lcal placement, depending on the crossing 
      angle, and also its size takes in account the new parameter 
      Ecal_Lcal_ring_gap which defines the distance between the Lcal and 
      the ring. 
      It has the same Ecal internal structure. It mean, the same number of 
      layers, the same thickness and the same Z placement as the end cap 
      modules, both for the radiator and Si layers. The only difference, 
      the sensitive Si layer is a flat plate of Si, without any structure 
      like wafers, guard rings or fiber walls. The cell size is the same as 
      for the Ecal end caps. The hits from this new device are written in 
      two new calorimeter hits  collections: EcalEndcapRingCollection and 
      EcalEndcapRingPreShowerCollection.

   V. New orientation for Ecal slabs in end caps

      The way to place the slabs inside the Ecal end cap modules is now
      turned of pi/2, in such way the alveolus are longer than before.
      It avoids projective cracks at (0,0,0) plan, but also it's now
      possible to configure a correct extra size for the end caps, around
      ~ 77 mm bigger than the Barrel. The current implementation has to
      be reviewed in the future, as it was done a bit quiclky for this
      release.
