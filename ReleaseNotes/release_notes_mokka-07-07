=================================

Please note that:

   This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.4 (and 9.4.patch01) and
   CLHEP 2.1.0.1

   It was tested against GEAR r386 and LCIO v02-00-pre00, gcc 3.4.6 and 4.1.2, 
   SL4 and SL5.

=================================

 I. Improvements of the FTD driver

  Thanks to Jordi Duarte new improvements are available in the FTD driver:

  * Included the z-staggered design of the petals.

     - The driver is compatible with both designs (staggered and turbine-blade).
       The database is containing a new field in the "disks" table: 
       petal_support_zoffset which define the stagger distance in z for the
       petals.
         Database ftd08 : z_offset=0.0, 
		petal_inclination_angle_support = 4.0 ---> turbine-blade design
         Database ftd09 : z_offset=1.5, 
		petal_inclination_angle_support  = 0.0----> staggered design,

       The FTD version for the new models (in the "ingredients" table) is the 
       SFtd10, but for optimization studies the SFtd09 subdetector (SFtd06.cc 
       and ftd08, turbine-design) can be used.

  * Included the GEAR persistency using the new FTDParameter and FTDLayerLayout 
    classes 

  * Fixed some geometric bugs (z-position of the sensor was not compatible 
    with the mechanical design)

  * Changed the FTD codification in the CGA/EncoderSi class and propagated the 
    change in the Tesla/TRKSD_FTD00 sensitive class.


II. The step position saving for the SDHcal

    In ' Detailed Shower Mode ' (while using  the command   
    /Mokka/init/lcioDetailedShowerMode true ), the step position in the SDHcal 
    sensitive volume is written to the LCIO file, together with the secondary 
    PDG.


III. Improvements of the AHCAL Barrel

    Thanks to Shaojun Lu, several improvements are available for the HCAL 
    Barrel:

    1. Put absorber and cassette into one: 20mm
    2. Remove cassette box from deriver for Barrel layer: 0.5mm
    3. Added Hcal_fiber_gap back into Barel layer: 1.7mm
    4. Remove layer_support_length from driver for Barrel layer: 0mm
    5. Update driver for lateral_structure_thickness, it only in the middle 
       between the two modules: 15mm
    6. Remove lateral_structure_thickness between Barrel and electronics 
       service. There could not be steel wall between readout electronics 
       board and HBU electronics baord.
    7. BarrelChamberSupportTrap has been removed from both header and source 
       code.
    8. Barrel module has been place with rotation, to keep the "lateral 
       structure" in the middle for both module.
    9. Update chamber_z_offset from "0" to "-Hcal_lateral_plate_thickness/2.0".
   10. All the relative x/y/z length and shift has been updated with the updated
       modification and parameters.
   11. The I-coordinate calculation has been updated inside "SHcalBarrel.cc". 
       Due to the rotation of Module inside ScHcalSc03, rotation for 
       I-coordinate has been updated too inside "SHcalBarrel.cc".


 IV. Improvements of the TPC implementation

  Thanks to Steve Aplin several improvements are available for the TPC driver:

  - the material of the TPC cathode grip ring was changed to carbon, and 
  - its dimension in z was reduced from 30 mm to 15 mm.


 V. Definition of three new detector models

    Three new ILD models were created, which contain the FTD, TPC, AHcal above 
    mentionned improvements  and - one of the models - the SDHcal. 

    The three models are: 

	ILD_01_pre02      - AHCal  and  Si-Ecal
	ILD_01_SDH_pre00  - SDHCal and  Si-Ecal
	ILD_01_SciW_pre00 - AHCal  and  Scintillator-Ecal


VI. Further improvements of Mokka implementation

    Thanks to Frank Gaerde, we have changes in the Coil drivers' Gear 
    parameters and the rename of CellID to CellID1 for SimTrackerHit.
