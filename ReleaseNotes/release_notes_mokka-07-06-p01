                             ===================

What is new in this Mokka release
=================================

   I. New driver SHcalRpc01
  II. New driver SHcalRpc02
 III. Update of models ILD_01_pre01 and ILD_01_pre01fw
  IV. LCPhysicsList removed
   V. Fixed lifetime of the pre-defined decays

=================================

Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.4 and CLHEP 2.1.0.1
   (but it is still compatible with previous Geant4 / CLHEP versions)
   It was tested against GEAR v00-14-02 and gcc 3.4.6 and 4.1.2, 
   SL4 and SL5.


2. This Mokka release only co-works with LCIO v01-51 and is no longer 
   compatible with previous LCIO releases, due to changes in LCIO v01-51.

==============================


   I. New driver SHcalRpc01

Thanks to our collaboration with Ran Han and her collagues from IPN Lyon,
a new driver implementing the GRPC Hcal was created. It is an improved version 
of previous driver SHcal04 (that follows the design suggested by Henri Videau): 
the thickness of the absorber backplate of the EndCaps is now the same as in 
the Analog Hcal, the numbering of barrel modules is corrected (it takes values 
from 1 to 5), and there are several changes in the geometry parameters.


  II. New driver SHcalRpc02

A further contribution of Ran Han and her collagues from IPN Lyon is the
new driver SHcalRpc02 that replaces, in the Analog Hcal, the scinillator 
layers and their associate components with GRPC layers identical to those 
in the GRPC Hcal.


 III. Update of models ILD_01_pre01 and ILD_01_pre01fw

As requested by Bogdan Pawlik, in order to take advantage of CPU saving, 
the new LumiCalV with virtual cells model replaced the old SLCal03 
sub_detector model.


  IV. LCPhysicsList removed

The LCPhysicsList (the LCPhys sub-directory) was removed from Mokka
because this physics list is no longer maintained and it doesn't compile
with new Geant4 version 9.4.

   V. Fixed lifetime of the pre-defined decays

Thanks to Mikael Berggren and Norman Graf, a bug was found concerning the
use of the lifetime of the pre-defined decays given by the stdhep files. 
Indeed this information can be available in the event file, it was not take 
in account by Mokka. 
The fix implements exactly the same as the SLIC code : the difference in 
time between the mother and the first daughter creation, found in the event 
file, is used to calculate and set up the mother proper time. It insures 
that the intermediate particle is propagated for that length of time and 
the (predefined) daughters are created at that time, with modifications 
to account for change in direction and energy loss.
