  What is new in this Mokka release
  =================================

  Thanks to people from DESY (gaede@mail.desy.de) we now have available
  the folowing features:

  I. Optional new treatment of the Monte Carlo truth information that is 
     stored in the LCIO file. 

  II. The complete steering file is writen to the LCIO outputfile.


  III. Allow factor for B-field to be larger than one.

  Thanks to Fabrizio Salvatore (p.salvatore@rhul.ac.uk) we now have available
  
  IV. New detector model TB07.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  We recommend to compile and link this new Mokka release mokka-05-03 
  with Geant 4 release 7.1.patch01

  New materials database "materials01" is the default sincemokka-05-02 .
  Users running a local database should download this new database from the 
  central MySQL server (pollin1.in2p3.fr) if they haven't done so.

  If you wish to use the physics list "LCPhys", make sure you compiled your
  Geant 4 installation with the "G4BERTINI_KAON" preprocessor flag defined.

 I. Optional new treatment of the Monte Carlo truth information that is stored 
    in the LCIO file. 
    In this new mode the complete list of particles present in the stdhep file 
    will also be copied to the MCParticle list in the LCIO outputfile.
    For all particles the original generator (HepEvt) status is preserved. 
    The dynamic attributes of the particles like four momentum, vertex and endpoint 
    are updated during the simulation, e.g. for predefined decays. 
    Particles that are created during simulation like decays in flight or nuclear 
    interactions in the tracker region are added to the list. The resulting list 
    of MCParticles is closer to what is expected in LCIO.
    This feature only works in LCIO mode with stdhep input files and is activated 
    by simply setting WriteCompleteHepEvt to true in the steering file: 
    
      /Mokka/init/userInitBool WriteCompleteHepEvt true


 II.The complete steering file is writen to the LCIO outputfile. It is written to the 
    (first) LCRunHeader parameter MOKKA_SteeringFile. This is particularly usefull if
    one uses the superdrivers in Mokka and overwrites some of the parameters.


 III. Allow factor for B-field to be larger than one. Now you can specify any factor > 0 
    for varying the B-field in the steering file or on the command line to study the B-field 
    dependence of the pflow algorithms.

  
  IV. New detector model TB07.  

  Thanks to Fabrizio Salvatore (p.salvatore@rhul.ac.uk) we now have available
  detector model TB07 that is detector model TB06 with the hodoscope added,
  implemented the complete Test Beam setup.
