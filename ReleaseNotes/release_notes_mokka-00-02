                    ===================

What is new:
- This release_note trace file.
- Added a the subdetector Hodoscope. It's not part of the Tesla 
  detector, but a device to be use for the test beam prototype 
  tests. Still in tests.
- Several improvements in the detector model coherence check before 
  loading a model to be simulated.
- Turn around for some drawn problems with the new Geant4 release
  when drawing prototype hits on the screen as polyline: just drawn
  as cercles.
- New macro directory with some Mokka macro command file samples
  (To be extended).

Dependencies:
 This Mokka release was tested with the following environment:
- Linux Red Hat 6.2
- gcc 2.95.2 
- MySQL 3.23.43
- Geant4 geant4-03-02-ref-07 tag

 But it should work without problems with early releases for these 
libraries or the gcc version egcs-2.91.66.

Known bugs:
- After geant4-03-02-ref-07 release the polylines are not more rendered 
  at all on the screen if using the Geant4 OpenGL driver.
- After some releases the Geant4 OpenGL driver is not more able to 
  render on the screen part of the Ecal boolean volumes. You'll get
  several warnings on the geant4 console at render time. Don't matter,
  the volumes are there!
