  What is new in this Mokka release
  =================================

   I. Updated Test Beam implementation.

   II. Configuration angle implementation for the CALICE Ecal prototype

   III. The slab shift values of database "CaliceEcal03" were modified
	
 This Mokka release was tested with Linux RedHat 7.3, 
gcc 3.2.2, CLHEP 1.8.0.0, Geant4 6.1 and geant4-06-02-ref-04
MySQL 3.23.49, LCIO v1.0 and v01-03, lStdHep.hh 1.5. 

Warning: running with LCIO v01-03 brings to the run time warning

"WARNING >>>>>>>  SimCalorimeterHitImpl::getNMCParticles() is
deprecated  - please use  SimCalorimeterHitImpl::getNMCContributions() !"

 which comes from LCIO v01-03, not from the Mokka code.

--------------------------------------------------

  I. Updated Test Beam implementation.

  The test beam models in source/Geometry/tbeam were
      updated to include the following subdetectors:
   
      a) Proto03  - detailed CALICE Ecal prototype
      
      b) TBhcal03 - HCal implementation with virtual cells

      c) TBcatcher03 - updated TCMT with accurate layering and virtual cells

      Collectively, these are still referred to as the "TB03" drivers.

      The TBSD_VCell03 sensitive detector, used for the 
      TBhcal03 and TBcatcher03 subdetectors, was rewritten to use the 
      global/local transform capabilities of touchable handles.  This 
      should improve performance, as the rewrite replaced a substantial 
      amount of computational code with calls to the Geant4 API.

      The config_angle concept was simplified and removed from the database.

      Currently, the only method for specifying the config_angle is a command 
      within the steering file.  Refer to release_notes_mokka-03-02, section VI.

      For instance, this command sets the config_angle to 40 degrees:

      /Mokka/init/CONFIG_ANGLE 40

      In the previous revision, the computation of placements using this 
      angle was incorrect for negative values, which lead to
      erroneously placed, overlapping subdetectors.  This bug has been
      fixed.

      A number of Test Beam models were removed from the MySQL server 
      to avoid duplication and confusion.  

      The active models are currently the following:

      a) TB03 - reference implementation with all subdetectors

      b) TB03_hcalcatch - HCal and TCMT prototypes, without Ecal

      Additional models may be added in the future, upon request.

      Items from section IX. of release_notes_mokka-03-02 still apply.  
      The reported Geant4 viewer problem has been resolved as a misunderstanding, 
      not a bug.

      Any problems or requests regarding the TB03 driver set and 
      its models should be sent to Roman Poeschl <poeschl@mail.desy.de> and 
      Jeremy McCormick <jeremym@slac.stanford.edu>, in addition to the
      primary Mokka maintainers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

   II. Configuration angle implementation for the CALICE Ecal prototype

   Until now, the different configuration angles of the Ecal prototype
   were planned to be implemented as different databases. Currently only
   the database corresponding to the normal incidence was implemented.

   Now, the configuration angle specified in the steering file can 
   alternately be used to set up the Ecal configuration. Specifically,
   if the field "c_angle_from_steering" of table "proto" is set to 'true',
   then the structure shifts are all calculated from the config angle
   as set in the steering file. The slab shifts of the "CaliceEcal03"
   database are still read, but they are added to the slab shifts
   calculated with the configuration angle. One should notice that the slab
   shifts values are limited so that the slabs still lie entirely inside
   the structure.

   A new method "CGASetTBConfigAngle" was added to the CGA interface.
   As an example of its usage, see example Ex06.f

   The configuration angle that was used within a run is written
   as the last variable in the Run.control file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

   III. The slab shift values of database "CaliceEcal03" were modified
   so that the gaps between the wafers are no longer alligned.
