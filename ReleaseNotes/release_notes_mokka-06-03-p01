                             ===================

What is new in this patch to Mokka release 6.3
=================================

   I. Implementation of separate rotation and X and Y translation of the Calice
      Ecal prototype
  II. Removed X and Y translation of Test Beam upstream detectors

===============================================================================

Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 8.1 patch 02 and CLHEP 2.0.2.3 
   LCIO v01-05, v01-06, v01-07 or v01-08-01, gcc 3.2.3, gcc 3.4.5 or
   gcc 4.1.1, SL3 or SL4, optionally with Gear v00-03

2. Due to the new definition of the materials, it doesn't work with
   Geant4 releases older than 8.1 any more.

===============================================================================

   I. Implementation of separate rotation and X and Y translation of the Calice
      Ecal prototype


   The separate Rotation and X and Y translations for the Ecal prototype (driver
   proto04_01) were implemented.  There are three new "global model parameters" 
   that one can change in the steering file with the following commands:

	/Mokka/init/globalModelParameter EcalTranslateX -20.0
	/Mokka/init/globalModelParameter EcalTranslateY 500.0

	/Mokka/init/globalModelParameter EcalRotationAngle 12.5

   Please note that the parameter "EcalRotationAngle" becomes the one that 
   should be used to set the rotation, instead of the previous parameter 
   "configuration_angle" that was used by the old models to set the overall 
   configuration angle of all detectors. This old parameter still exists in the 
   DB in order to allow users of previous models to set the angle.

  II. Removed X and Y translation of Test Beam upstream detectors

   According to the new coordinate system, the beam is kept fixed, so there is
   no need for the upstream detectors to translate. The global model 
   parameters TranslateX and TranslateY are no longer read by the upstream
   detector drivers.
