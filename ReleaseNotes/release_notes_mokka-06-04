What is new in this Mokka release 
=================================

   I. Changes in the implementation of primary generators. General Particle 
      Source added.

  II. Removing instantiation of physics lists that became obsolete since
      Geant4 8.2, and adding new available ones.

 III. Patches to Geant4 classes G4NistElementBuilder and G4RunManager

  IV. New implementation of SiT driver and DB sit01

===============================================================================

Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 8.3 and CLHEP 2.0.3.1
   LCIO v01-05, v01-06, v01-07 or v01-08-01, gcc 3.2.3, gcc 3.4.5 or
   gcc 4.1.1, SL3 or SL4, optionally with Gear v00-04

===============================================================================


   I. Changes in the implementation of primary generators. General Particle 
      Source added.


      The implementation of primary generators was changed by adding wrapper
      classes. Particularily, a wrapper class was added that manages the
      usage of class G4GeneralParticleSource. The selection of primary
      generator remains unchanged, by the UI command

	/generator/generator XXX

      where XXX can be particleGun, gps or a file name.

      Old particleGun UI commands are unchanged too. New commands are available
      from Geant4 for the gps usage.



  II. Removing instantiation of physics lists that became obsolete since
      Geant4 8.2, and adding new available ones.

      The class PhysicsListFactory belonging to Mokka Kernel was changed:
      physics lists that became obsolete since Geant4 release 8.2 were
      removed, and the new ones were added.

      The Kernel GNUmakefile was also changed to become compatible with
      the Geant4 structure (Geant4 Physics Lists were moved to the Geant4
      Kernel, and are automatically handeled by the Geant4 GNUmakefiles).


 III. Patches to Geant4 classes G4NistElementBuilder and G4RunManager

      File Mokka.cc was changed to include two patches for the Geant4
      classes G4NistElementBuilder and G4RunManager in order to avoid
      crash due to the versions of these classes that came with Geant4 8.3.
      The first one ensures proper element instantiation, and the second
      avoids a crash at end of event.

      Mokka Kernel class RunManager was also corrected according to new
      policy of G4RunManager, and that also avoids a crash at the
      beginning of successive runs.


  IV. New implementation of SiT driver and DB sit01
      
      Thanks to Hengne Li (e-mail: li@lal.in2p3.fr) we now have available
      new improved implementation of Sit sub-detector, with the correct
      density and radiation length for silicon material, and with the
      right model of the insensitive material. This new implementation
      is available as sub-detector sit01.
