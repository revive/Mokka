                    ===================
What is new in this new Mokka release
=====================================

I) New command /generator/randomDirections 

  Shoots N times the same particle with the same energy
but with random directions (phi0 < phi < phi1,
theta0 < theta < theta1) from the actual gun position.

  The command syntax is:

  /generator/randomDirections phi0 phi1 theta0 theta1 NShoots


II) Run.control file coherence against the line command options

  When launching Mokka, if an existing directory is given as 
output (option -o) Mokka assumes that it's a "restart". In 
the restart mode the Run.control file contents found in the 
existing directory takes over the line command options. It's 
sometimes dangerous and not clear for the user. 

 For this reason we introduce in this release a new coherence test 
between the actual command line options and the the Run.control 
file contents, if any. If it's not coherent Mokka aborts.


III) Calorimeters: max step allowed in sensitive material
-------------------------------------------------------

  In the sensitive material for calorimeters, the cells do not 
really exist as G4 volumes so the steps are not limited 
on the cell's boundaries by the geometry process. To avoid long 
steps over running several cells, the max step allowed inside the 
sensitive material is now set to the pad smaller x or z dimension, 
thanks to an G4UserLimits object attached to the sensitive volume. 
It's almost a cosmetic fix: the multiscattering and other physics 
processes should limit the step size less than the pad dimensions.
But to insure and to increase the accuracy in the total energy 
deposited in the cells, it's fixed. It concerns the following 
drivers in this release: ecal02, hcal03 and proto01.


IV) Fixes in some line command diagnostics

  In the last releases the character "-" was accepted as starting
file names or other parameters. For this reason sometimes the
diagnostic for some line command errors were wrong. It's now
fixed, in this release it's no more accepted "-" as a starting
parameter value.


=====================================
To be done:
==========
(just to not forget and not in this order)

1) Mokka Kernel

- review for the Control class: it should be implemented as 
  singleton and to keep the actual static members as attributs

2) Persistency

- to implement the Root Tree file format option;
- to implement the SIO file format option.

3) Simple Event Display

- to implement track and hits selection commands for display.
- to implement sub-detector selection command for display.
- to implement run time color selection commands.
- to implement a graphic interface to short cut the Geant4 
  visualization commands syntax.

Dependencies:
 This Mokka release was tested with the following environments:
- Linux Red Hat 6.2 and Linux Red Hat 7.3
- gcc 2.95.2 and 2.95.3
- MySQL 3.23.43
- Geant4 release geant4-04-01-ref-03

Known bugs:
- After geant4-03-02-ref-07 release the polylines are not more rendered 
  at all on the screen if using the Geant4 OpenGL driver. To turn around
  the proto hits are drawn as dots.
- After some releases the Geant4 OpenGL driver is not more able to 
  render on the screen part of the Ecal boolean volumes. You'll get
  several warnings on the geant4 console at render time. Don't matter,
  the volumes are there!
===> This problem was officially comunnicated to the Geant4 visualization
     team with simple examples <============
