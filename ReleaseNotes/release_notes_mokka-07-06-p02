                             ===================

What is new in this Mokka release
=================================

  I. Fixed lifetime of b-baryons
 II. Abort if physics list not found
III. G4EmSaturation patch files removed from Mokka
 IV. G4LossTableManager patch

=================================

Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.4 (and 9.4.patch01) and 
   CLHEP 2.1.0.1 (but it is still compatible with previous Geant4 / CLHEP 
   versions)

   It was tested against GEAR v00-14-02 and gcc 3.4.6 and 4.1.2, 
   SL4 and SL5.


2. This Mokka release only co-works with LCIO v01-51 and is no longer 
   compatible with previous LCIO releases, due to changes in LCIO v01-51.

==============================

I. Fixed lifetime of b-baryons

Following the fix for the lifetime of pre-defined decays in the last
Mokka patch, another independent bug was found concerning the lifetime
of certain particles, including b-baryons.  Because these particles
were not known to Mokka/G4, their flight length was previously
ignored.

The fix again follows the SLIC implementation by reading a text file
which contains a list of particles.  Any particle not known to Mokka
is added to the table of known particles, also defining their material
interaction.  The default filename is particle.tbl (configurable via
the command /Mokka/init/PDGFile), which is now included in the Mokka
distribution.


 II. Abort if physics list not found

Until now, when the physics list specified by the user was not found
by the physics list factory, the default physics list was used and a
warning message was issued.

Since this message can go unnoticed, the behavior was changed: if the
physics list is not found, then Mokka aborts with the error code
MOKKA_ERROR_PHYSICS_LIST_NOT_FOUND ().


III. G4EmSaturation patch files removed from Mokka

The .cc and .hh files of class G4EmSaturation were removed from Mokka.
They were added to Mokka when they were not part of Geant4. Now Geant4 
has an improved version of this class, and we use that one. 


 IV. G4LossTableManager patch

In order to be able to compile with Geant4 9.4, Mokka includes a patch
of file G4LossTableManager.cc from Geant4 9.4.patch01.
