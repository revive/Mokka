What is new in this new Mokka release
=====================================

 Several fixes:

I) Fixes in the general tracker sensitive detector
--------------------------------------------------

   All the tracker devices in the current Mokka release
share the same tracker sensitive detector object, the "TRKSD".
It was developed for the TPC and then generalized for the
inner tracking devices (VXD, SIT, FTD). Unfortunately the 
inner tracking layers don't share surfaces as in the TPC
and, in very special cases, it leads to an error when calculating 
the layer middle point for these inner tracking devices.

 In this release part of the TRKSD class code is rewrote do
fix this bug.

 Concern only the tracking devices (TPC, VXD, SIT, FTD).

II) Fixes in the Common Geometry Access (CGA) interface
-------------------------------------------------------

The following fixes were done concerning the Common Geometry Access
(CGA) Interface:

1. In class CGASteppingAction, method UserSteppingAction: The 
particle is stopped if it reaches the final volume defined by 
the final point that you specified with CGABeamOn. It was noticed 
that if the final point was on the surface of a volume the particle 
was never stopped. Now, this final point can be given not only inside 
but also on the surface of a volume, so that the particle can be 
properly stopped in both cases, and the subroutines CGAGetSteps and 
CGAGetVolumeData return correct results.

2. In subroutine  CGAWhereAmI: It was noticed that if the point was on
the surface of a volume, two successive calls of this method returned 
the names of the two neighbour volumes. This bug was fixed and both 
successive calls of CGAWhereAmI give the same volume name, that on 
which surface the point is situated on.

 Concerns only reconstruction code using the CGA API. Thanks to Gabriel 
Musat for these fixes.

=====================================
To be done:
==========
(just to not forget and not in this order)

1) Mokka Kernel

- review for the Control class: it should be implemented as 
  singleton and to keep the actual static members as attributs

2) Persistency

- to implement the Root Tree file format option;
- to implement the SIO file format option.

3) Simple Event Display

- to implement track and hits selection commands for display.
- to implement sub-detector selection command for display.
- to implement run time color selection commands.
- to implement a graphic interface to short cut the Geant4 
  visualization commands syntax.

Dependencies:
 This Mokka release was tested with the following environments:
- Linux Red Hat 6.2 and Linux Red Hat 7.3
- gcc 2.95.2 and 2.95.3
- MySQL 3.23.43
- Geant4 release geant4-04-01-ref-03

Known bugs:
- After geant4-03-02-ref-07 release the polylines are not more rendered 
  at all on the screen if using the Geant4 OpenGL driver. To turn around
  the proto hits are drawn as dots.
- After some releases the Geant4 OpenGL driver is not more able to 
  render on the screen part of the Ecal boolean volumes. You'll get
  several warnings on the geant4 console at render time. Don't matter,
  the volumes are there!
===> This problem was officially comunnicated to the Geant4 visualization
     team with simple examples <============
