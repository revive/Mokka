                    ===================
		    (or LCWS05 release)

   *** It's a major release! Local database copies HAVE TO 
   upload the new models01 database from our Mokka central 
   database, on pollin1.in2p3.fr ***

  What is new in this Mokka release
  =================================

  I. Detector setup and the new models database schema
 II. New detector model D11
III. New detector model ProtoDesy0205
 IV. Bug fixes in old Ecal driver and endcap sensitive detector

     This release is compliant with Geant4 07-00. In order to run it
  with previous Geant4 releases one should use the source/Kernel/GNUmakefile
  the java/CGA/GNUmakefile and the examples/CGA/GNUmakefile of the previous 
  Mokka release.

------------------------------------------------------------

I. Detector setup and the new models database schema

   Thanks to this new models database schema, detector drivers are 
   able to share global parameters describing the collider parameters, 
   the "detector family" and detector special setups.

   This current implementation is 100% backward compatible with the
   old sub detector drivers, BUT local database copies HAVE TO upload 
   the new models01 database from our Mokka central database, 
   on pollin1.in2p3.fr

   Sub detector drivers sharing setup parameters should not implement 
   the old virtual construct(...) method, but the  

   virtual 
   G4bool ContextualConstruct(const
    CGAGeometryEnvironment &aGeometryEnvironment,
    G4LogicalVolume *theWorld);

   new one. The actual database name which the driver should open can be
   retrieved thanks to the CGAGeometryEnvironment's "G4String GetDBName()"
   method. Moreover, the CGAGeometryEnvironment object carries only the 
   geometry parameters which the called driver depends on. All the setup 
   parameters are initialized to theirs default values specified in the 
   sharing table, then overwritten by the actual setup values if any,
   before calling the sub detector driver. It means that the sub detector
   driver code should not care about if a given parameter exists in the
   actual CGAGeometryEnvironment object.

   The others public CGAGeometryEnvironment methods are:
   
   const G4String GetDetectorConcept ();
   G4String GetParameterAsString (G4String PName);
   G4double GetParameterAsDouble (G4String PName);
   G4int GetParameterAsInt (G4String PName);

   The actual setup can be specified at run time via the new init steering 
   file command

     /Mokka/init/detectorSetup  <setup>

   or via the new line command option

     .../Mokka ...   -s <setup> ...

   where <setup> has to be a valid name in the models01 database.

   If not specified, the setup name defaults to "" (use only the default 
   values)


II. New detector model D11 

   Detector model D11 contains new sub-detector ecal04. The Ecal
   barrel and endcap silicon layers are divided into wafers and cells.
   Wafer guard-rings are divided in 3 zones as specified in the
   database. Full wafers are 6 by 6 cells, but smaller wafers
   are added to fill as much as possible the silicon layers.


III. New detector model ProtoDesy0205

   Detector model ProtoDesy0205 contain the Calice Ecal prototype
   with all slabs shifted by the same amount, which means that all
   wafer gaps are aligned, as it was used at the Desy shifts in
   February 2005.


IV. Bug fixes in old Ecal driver and endcap sensitive detector

   A bug that affected the endcap hits was fixed. This involved
   old ecal02 driver and the sensitive detector of its endcap.
   The errors were small: -0.1 mm in the X direction, -0.6 mm
   in the Y direction and +/- 0.25 mm in the Z direction
   (+ for the +Z endcap and - for the -Z endcap).
