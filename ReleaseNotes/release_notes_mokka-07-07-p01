What is new in this Mokka release
=================================

  I. Improvements of the VXD driver

 II. New version of Analogue Hadron Calorimeter for ILD with Videau geometry 
     of the Barrel.

III. Definition of a new development detector model

=================================

Please note that:

   This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.4 (and 9.4.patch01) and
   CLHEP 2.1.0.1

   It was tested against GEAR r386 and LCIO v02-00-pre00, gcc 3.4.6 and 4.1.2, 
   SL4 and SL5.

=================================

  I. Improvements of the VXD driver

     Thanks to Georgios Gerasimos Voutsinas, we have now a new and more 
     realistic VXD implementation, following the description made by 
     Yasuhiro Sugimoto (details at 
     http://llr.in2p3.fr/~musat/VXD/YasuhiroSugimoto/VTX_design110823.pdf). 

     Currently only the inner part pf the VXD is improved.

     In the mokka steering file, this sub-detector can be switch on with
	
	/Mokka/init/subDetector vxd07


 II. New version of Analogue Hadron Calorimeter for ILD with Videau geometry 
     of the Barrel.

     Thanks to Shaojun Lu we have a new driver SHcalScV01 for the AHCal with
     the Barrel geometry suggested by Henri Videau. It has a new sensitive 
     detector for the 'A la Videau' barrel filled with scintillator sensitive 
     layers. The endCap and endCapRing are identical to SHcalSc03.

     In the mokka steering file, this sub-detector can be switch on with
	
	/Mokka/init/subDetector SHcalScV01


III. Definition of a new development detector model

     Thanks to Steve Aplin we have a development detector model 'ILD_01_dev', 
     which is  based on ILD_01pre02, with the following changes:

	- sit_simple_planar instead of SSit04, 
	- ftd_simple_staggered instead of SFtd10
 	- set_simple_planar instead of SSet03 
	- and SEtd03 removed
