===============================================================================

Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.1.p02 and CLHEP 2.0.3.2
   (but it is still compatible with previous Geant4 / CLHEP versions)
   LCIO v01-10-03 (needed !!) 
   gcc 3.2.3, gcc 3.4.5 or
   gcc 4.1.1, SL3 or SL4, optionally with Gear v00-11

===============================================================================

   I. Bug fix on mass information in MC particle

   A bug let Mokka to use the PDG mass value instead the dynamic one
   when registering the mass of MC particles for lcio and ASCII output
   file format. It concerns only the MCParticle information on the 
   MCParticle collection, without consequences for physics. This bug
   is now fixed.

   II. New detector model ILD_00fwp01

   This new model is the same as ILD_00fw, except it uses the tubeX05 
   sub_detector insteed the tubeX04 one. It removes some gaps and 
   overlaps found in the previous model where the beamtube splits into 
   upstream and downstream parts. (Thanks to Andr√© Sailer from CERN)

   III. Bug fix of particle energy value in ASCII output

   The value of the energy returned by TrackSummary::GetEnergy() 
   was corrected. 

   For some of the particles, the 'energy' attribute of TrackSummary was 
   initialized with the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. 
   That affected only the ASCII output of Mokka (part of the content of 
   the eventXXXXXX.kin files). Now, TrackSummary::GetEnergy() returns the
   total energy.


   IV. Bug fix in TRKSD00 and TRKSiSD00 classes

   This bug made that the last energy deposits of particles that
   were stopped in the detector were lost. It was first noticed for 
   electrons that were stopped in the VXD layers, but the same was 
   true also for the other tracker sub-detectors that used the 
   sensitive detector class TRKSD00.

   V. Bug fix in modifying the tracker and calorimeter region
      via steering file commands

   Commands like 

   /Mokka/init/globalModelParameter  name_region_Vmax  Value

   in steering file should force new values for the parameters 
   tracker_region_rmax, tracker_region_zmax, calorimeter_region_rmax
   and calorimeter_region_zmax, which defines the tracker and
   calorimeter regions at run time. Unfortunately a bug in recent
   releases disabled this feature. It's now fixed.


   VI. Bug fix in CalHit and TRKHit classes

   The energy saved in the ASCII output files was expressed in MeV.
   The fix makes ASCII output consistent to LCIO output, both having
   energy values in GeV now.


   VII. Bug fix in class Encoder64Muon

   The correction refers to the encoding of the K index (layer number),
   that gave wrong CellID in the hit collection of the muon (yoke) 
   in the LCIO output file (ASCII output was correct).



VIII. new field driver FieldX03 with 2D solenoid field map
   A new driver for a magnetic field using a 2D field map for the solenoid 
   field has been created. This is based on B field simulations for ILD done
   by A. Pretrov, DESY.
   The subdetector model 'fieldX03' is based on that field map and an
   anti-DID field map, scaled such that low ebnergetic particles drift from 
   the IP into the outgoing beam pipe.

 IX. New TPC Sensitive Detector TPCSD03 and dedidcated step limitation 
   for low Pt charged particles in the TPC sensitive volume, TPCStepLimiterLowPt. 
   Functionality has been added which limits the step length of charged particles 
   in the TPC which are below a certain Pt. The Pt cut, and the step limit are 
   steerable via init commands. The functionality is by default switched off and 
   must be switched on via "/Mokka/init/TPCLowPtStepLimit true". The steplimitation 
   is performed by the new process TPCStepLimiterLowPt, which is based on the GEANT4 
   StepLimiter. Acting on this steplimited set of particles is a new TPC sensitive 
   detector TPCSD03 which is used in the new driver TPC07. Hits are written out once 
   the cumulative path length of the particle in the TPC reaches a predefined value,
   or the particle stops in the TPC sensitive volume. This maximum distance between
   hits is by default 5mm, whilst the step limit is by default 1mm, again both 
   parameters are steerable.

  X. New FTD driver SFtd05.cc to fix bug in cable thickness in SFtd04.cc
   There was a bug in the thickness of the cables in SFtd04.cc where instead
   of the cables being of the correct thickness the kapton shielding was 
   incorrectly copper in addition. This is fixed in SFtd05.cc, which has
   also been cleaned up a bit. It is used in the Mokka subdetector SFtd08 in
   detector model ILD_00fwp01.


  XI. Bug fix in SEcalSD02.cc
   Fixed bug which could let to bad values for X in the cell coordinates
   in the Ecal end caps, in special cases.
