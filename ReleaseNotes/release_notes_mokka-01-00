                    New tag mokka-01-00    
                    ===================
       (It's the "Mokka Summer 2002 reference tag")

What is new in this new Mokka release
=====================================

1) Implemented the visualization of TPC hits, so even early Mokka
   productions can now be viewed with the Mokka Simple Event Display.

2) Fixed a minor bug in the Mokka interactive commands creation,
   to avoid segment fault when leaving Mokka in very special
   cases.

3) Fixed a minor bug in the Proto01 geometry driver when placing
   odd number of W segments in a lane (never used before).

4) Cosmetic changes to fix all the compilation warnings with 
   gcc 2.95.x 

=====================================
To be done:
==========
(just to not forget and not in this order)

1) Mokka Kernel
- particleGun: the user should be able to shoot the same particle
  with the same energy but with random directions inside a solid
  angle;

- review for the Control class: it should be implemented as 
  singleton and to keep the actual static members as attributs

2) Persistency

- to implement the Root Tree file format option;
- to implement the SIO file format option.

3) Simple Event Display

- to implement track and hits selection commands for display.
- to implement sub-detector selection command for display.
- to implement run time color selection commands.
- to implement a graphic interface to short cut the Geant4 
  visualization commands syntax.

4) Geometry drivers
- several geometry drivers should be rewrote: TPC, FCH, masks, etc.

Dependencies:
 This Mokka release was tested with the following environments:
- Linux Red Hat 6.2 and Linux Red Hat 7.3
- gcc 2.95.2 and 2.95.3
- MySQL 3.23.43
- Geant4 geant4-04-00-patch2 (DO NOT INSTALL THE 
  geant4-04-01-ref-00 release, it's buggy! Wait for the
  Geant4 August patch, coming soon.)

Known bugs:
- After geant4-03-02-ref-07 release the polylines are not more rendered 
  at all on the screen if using the Geant4 OpenGL driver. To turn around
  the proto hits are drawn as dots.
- After some releases the Geant4 OpenGL driver is not more able to 
  render on the screen part of the Ecal boolean volumes. You'll get
  several warnings on the geant4 console at render time. Don't matter,
  the volumes are there!
===> This problem was officially comunnicated to the Geant4 visualization
     team with simple examples <============
