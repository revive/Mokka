                    New tag mokka-00-04
                    ===================

What is new:
===========
- The compatibility with the Geant4 release 4.0 is turned on
  via the "G4R4" macro definition in the CPPFLAGS. It's set up as the 
  defaut. If you are using an earlier Geant4 release, please, drop 
  this option in your GNUMakefile local copy.
- New Proto01 geometry driver is able to take in account
  the metrology of the tungsten plates. It's not backward
  compatible with the old proto databases and it should
  become the reference prototype geometry driver.
- Fixed Proto00 geometry driver to take in account the
  wafer_shift parameter in the alveolus length, avoiding 
  overlaps.
- Fixed MySQLWrapper to abord execution if a query fails.

To be done:
==========
(just to not forget and not in this order)

1) Mokka Kernel
- particleGun: the user should be able to shoot the same particle
  with the same energy but with random directions inside a solid
  angle;
- VSubDetectorDriver: the concatenation of the sub detector name 
  with the true event number should be a basic service provided by
  the VSubDetectorDriver base class. The developer should no more
  be concerned with the Control::SYNCEVT kernel feature.
- Mokka should be able to provide automatic Geant4 geometry translation
  to the LC/XML format, as it's already done for Brahms/Geant3.
- As discussed at the "LC Simulation Meeting at Cern" (Nov 15-16,2001),
  Mokka should be split in two software layers, the Mokka kernel
  and a "LC Geometry facility". The "LC Geometry facility" should
  provide several API interfaces to export the same geometry 
  specifications to the reconstruction and the analyses applications.
- As discussed at the "LC Simulation Meeting at Cern" (Nov 15-16,2001),
  Mokka should provide a "Root like" data output format as an user
  option.

2) Geometry drivers
- several geometry drivers should be rewrote: TPC, FCH, masks, etc.

Dependencies:
 This Mokka release was tested with the following environment:
- Linux Red Hat 6.2
- gcc 2.95.3 (but it should work without problems with early 
  releases or with the egcs-2.91.66 compiler).
- MySQL 3.23.43
- Geant4 geant4-04-00-ref-00 tag (see the "G4R4" macro 
  definition in the CPPFLAGS described above).

Known bugs:
- After geant4-03-02-ref-07 release the polylines are not more rendered 
  at all on the screen if using the Geant4 OpenGL driver. To turn around
  the proto hits are drawn as dots.
- After some releases the Geant4 OpenGL driver is not more able to 
  render on the screen part of the Ecal boolean volumes. You'll get
  several warnings on the geant4 console at render time. Don't matter,
  the volumes are there!
