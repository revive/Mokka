===============================================================================

   I. New detector model ILD_00

   A new model 'ILD_00' was created for the ILD simulation 
   baseline reference detector. It is based on the detector parameters 
   discussed at Cambridge and in the current DRAFT ILDReference document 
   (www.ilcild.org). 
   
   One needs this version of Mokka and a GEAR version v00-11 to use 
   this model (gear now has parameters for the coil, lhcal and the Yoke). 

   The following detector drivers are updated or new implementation:

	I.1) New HCAL superdriver SHcalSc02 (Angela Lucaci)

	It's a new HCAL superdriver with modified endcaps as in
 	the Tesla design, that is with a square hole in the middle,
	and cracks along the square borders. The basic endcap stave 
	is a union of a box and a right wedge.
	
	The modified geometry needed a new sensitive detector class
	for the HCAL endcaps: SDHcalEndCapTesla. 

	Note that this is used only for the endcaps. The HCAL rings
	still use the old class SDHcalEndCap. 

	In the endcaps, the HCAL layers are perpendicular to the
	z-axis. In the x-y plane, the virtual tiles are square, with the 
	dimensions 30x30 mm^2. Hits in tiles which are not fully
	contained  in	the sensitive volume are rejected. The
	counting of the I and J cell coordinates starts from the
	lower left corner of the stave, in the x-y plane. The
	notation of the staves is the same as in the old geometry
	(for more details, see 
	http://www-flc.desy.de/lcnotes/notes/LC-TOOL-2008-001.pdf)   
	
	I.2) New LHcal superdriver SLHcal01 

	This new super driver implements the LHcal as a parallelepiped 
	volume, with size = 330.6 mm, 525 mm long. It's placed inside 
	the Hcal end cap (30 mm after the end cap entering boundary). 
	Its central hole is a cylinder which is not centered, but 
	which should follow the crossing angle to avoid overlapping 
	the beam pipe.

	The LHcal has 40 W layers of 10 mm, behind each one a Si 
	sensitive layer almost as the Ecal rings. For this reason 
	SLHcal01 reuses the same sensitive detector implemented
	for the Ecal rings. The only difference is that the
	SLHcal01 has not a pre-shower layer.For this reason
	SLHcal01 depends on the Ecal slab parameters, as it's almost
	the same technology.

	SLHcal01 depends on the following global parameters, with the 
        current values for the ILD_00:
	
	Ecal_Alveolus_Air_Gap = 0.25
	Ecal_Si_thickness = 0.5
  	Ecal_Slab_PCB_thickness = 0.8
   	Ecal_Slab_copper_thickness = 0.2
   	Ecal_Slab_glue_gap = 0.1
   	Ecal_Slab_ground_thickness = 0.05
   	Ecal_Slab_shielding = 0.15
   	Ecal_fiber_thickness = 0.2
   	Hcal_endcap_center_box_size = 700.0
   	Hcal_endcap_zmin = 2670.7
   	LHcal_Electronics_space = 19.4
   	LHcal_cell_size = 10
   	LHcal_inner_radius = 93
   	LHcal_lateral_face_thickness = 10
   	LHcal_nlayers = 40
   	LHcal_radiator_thickness = 10
   	LHcal_zmin_displacement = 30
   	TUBE_crossing_angle = 14

	Currently SLHcal01 exports the following parameters, with the 
        current values for the ILD_00:
	LHcal_zend = 3225.7

	I.3) New LCAL superdriver SLcal02 (B. Pawlik)

	SLcal02 superdriver does not have database, only parameters.
	For actual build of LCAL LumiCalX subdriver is used.
	SLcal02 sets the z-position of LCAL (Lcal_z_begin parameter)
	according to the value of the Ecal_endcap_zmax. It also assures that
	outer radius of LCAL ( Lcal_outer_radius parameter) is consistent with
	inner radius of ECAL endcap plug. It checks whether lenght of LCAL
	fits into space in ECAl endcup.  
	Parameters known to SLcal02 are :

         name                  default value              comment
        ------                 --------------
	Lcal_z_begin              3050      mm   
	Lcal_inner_radius           80.0    mm
	Lcal_outer_radius          195.2    mm
	Lcal_n_layers               30
	Lcal_phi_offset              0.     deg    
	Lcal_tungsten_thickness      3.5    mm        thickness of absorber
	Lcal_support_thickness       0.2    mm        fanout,interconnection
                                                      plane thickness
	Lcal_silicon_thickness       0.32   mm        silicon sensor
	Lcal_layer_gap               0.25   mm        clearance between LCAL
                                                      planes
	Lcal_nstrips_theta          64                radial segmentation
	Lcal_nstrips_phi            48                number of phi sectors

	SLcal02 needs also following 'exetrnal' parameters normally set SEcal03
	superdriver.

	Ecal_Lcal_ring_gap    - clearance between LCAL and ECAL endcap PLUG
	Ecal_endcap_zmax
	Ecal_endcup_zmin
	Ecal_endcap_plug_rmin
	ILC_Main_Crossing_Angle 
 
	The default values of parameters above, can be changed by user at  run 
	time with the card:

        /Mokka/init/globalModelParameter "parameter_name" value

	NOTE: Functionality of changing  Lcal_z_begin, and Lcal_outer_radius 
              at run time is limited in case ECAL is build.


	I.4) New implementation for Yoke and Coil (F. Gaede)
	   SCoil02.cc:
         - replace hardcoded values by parameters:
   	   Hcal_Coil_additional_gap, Coil_Yoke_radial_clearance and
	   Coil_Yoke_lateral_clearance

           Yoke04.cc
         -  added barrelEndcapGap, gear parameters, made barrel and endcap 
            same thickness, made plug insensitive
	 - changed outer r of yoke plug to be aligned with hcal endcap

	I.5) New Bcal superdriver SBcal01 (A.Hartin)

	    - first implementation, code from Fcal collaboration,
      	* position of sensitive layer corrected
     	* several constants moved to beamcal table
     	* superdriver by A. Sapronov, A. Rosca and A. Popescu
     	* implemented in Mokka by A. Hartin and S. Aplin, Oct 2008
	
	I.6) New FTD self scaling driver SFtd04.cc (S. Aplin)
		
		Implementation of a self scaling 7 disk FTD first 3 Disks are Si-pixel technology

	I.7)  New SIT self scaling driver SSit03.cc ( S. Aplin )
		
		The radius of the sensitive layer of the outer layer is defined by the distance to the TPC 
		inner radius. The radius of the sensitive layer of the inner layer is defined by the relative
		position between the SIT outer layer and the VTX outer layer.
		Half-lengths in z are defined relative to the TPC ECal barrel length

	
	I.8)  New SET self scaling driver SSet02.cc ( S. Aplin )
		
		The SET is composed of two support backed silicon layers.

		The radius of the outer layer is specified by the distance to the min Radius of the ECal 
		Barrel. The radius of the inner layer is specified by the radial distance between the two 
		layers. Both layers have the same Half-length as the TPC 
	
	I.9)  New ETD self scaling dirver ( S. Aplin )
	 	
	 	The inner radius of disks defined by the radial clearance between the ETD  and ECal-EndCap 
	 	Plug outer radius of disks defined by radial difference from the TPC outer radius z 
	 	positions are given by the distance between the last ETD sensitive layer and the 
	 	ECal-EndCap face plus layer separation and thickness.


   II. bug fix in TRKSD00
      
   Piotr Niezurawski noticed that the sensitive detector implemented in 
   class TRKSD00 had a bug, as described by him at:

   http://polzope.in2p3.fr:8081/MOKKA/issues-tracker/4

   This class, originally designed to work with the first versions of the 
   TPC, was then adopted by many other sub-detectors: ETD, FTD, SET, SiT, VXD.

   Piotr made a correction of this bug, the class was renamed to TRKSiSD00 
   and the necessary corrections were made to all VXD drivers so that they 
   now use this new class. 



   III. New TB models for Cern 2007 and FNAL 2008

   We have 3 new models for TBCern 2007, that have the new DCHs implementation  
   made by Fabrizio Salvatore (like the Desy/FNAL DCHs, i.e. with one single 
   hit collection and each chamber sub-divided in two halves, one for x-hits 
   and one for y-hits). Their names are:
 
    TBCern07_dchxy_01 (with the ideal Ecal),
    TBCern0707_dchxy_01 (with the Ecal in Jully 07 config), and
    TBCern0807_dchxy_01(with the Ecal in the August 07 config).

   An implementation was made for the TB setup at FNAL, the first period 
   of  '08, except the wire chambers and the detectors before them. 
   The model name is     TBFnal0508


  IV. moved CGAGearDistanceProperties and CGAGearPointProperties
      from gear to Mokka ( libMokkaGear.a ) (F.Gaede)

     moved the code from GEAR to Mokka in order to remove circular dependency 

   V. fix for reading problematic stdhep files (M.Berggren, F.Gaede)
     
   Fix in HepLCIOInterface for reading problematic stdhep files with FSR on mu and tau leptons.
   These files caused double counting of the leptons in older versions of Mokka.
   The old behaviour can be restored with:

     /Mokka/init/FixStdHepLeptonFSR false
     
   Note: the generator status of 'documentation' type particles that are not presented to geant4
   is increased by 100, e.g if the particle had genstat 2 it will have genstat 102 after processing 
    
  VI. new command  /Mokka/init/lcioEventParameter (F.Gaede)

    this command allows to specify constant parameters in the steering file that are
    then added to every LCIO event, eg. 

    /Mokka/init/lcioEventParameter float CrossSection_fb 1234.56
    /Mokka/init/lcioEventParameter string Process e3e3h_250_ep+1.0_em-1.0
    /Mokka/init/lcioEventParameter int ProcessID 42
