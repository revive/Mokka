                    ===================

What is new on detectors:
=========================

- The new set00 geometry driver, able to build the sub detector
  "Silicon External Tracker" in study at LPNHE-Paris VI. For the
  moment the geometry and material are okay, but hits are to be
  foreseen (thanks to Frederic Kapusta and Aurora Savoy-Navarro).

- The new SET00 database, keeping the geometry data for the set00
   geometry driver.

- A new TPC database release, the tpc02, smaller in radius to leave
  place for the SET sub detector.

- A new general model, the D08SET one, as the D08 but with
  tpc02 and SET00.

What is new on internals:
=========================

- Several changes in the Mokka Kernel to be compliant with the new
  persistency abstraction schema. For the end user it's completely
  transparent. For geometry drivers developers it's backward
  compatible, indeed we advice people writing geometry drivers
  to adopt the new schema. Please, let me know if you have
  troubles with this new release (the new documentation is
  coming soon)

- Several changes in the Mokka Kernel to implement a basic event
  display facility. It's not yet ready for use, so the new command
  line option "-v" is not yet available. Coming soon...

To be done:
==========
(just to not forget and not in this order)

1) Mokka Kernel
- particleGun: the user should be able to shoot the same particle
  with the same energy but with random directions inside a solid
  angle;
- As discussed at the "LC Simulation Meeting at Cern" (Nov 15-16,2001),
  Mokka should be split in two software layers, the Mokka kernel
  and a "LC Geometry facility". The "LC Geometry facility" should
  provide several API interfaces to export the same geometry 
  specifications to the reconstruction and the analyses applications.

2) Geometry drivers
- several geometry drivers should be rewrote: TPC, FCH, masks, etc.
  Suggestions and/or voluntiers, please, send a mail to

Dependencies:
 This Mokka release was tested with the following environment:
- Linux Red Hat 6.2
- gcc 2.95.3 
- MySQL 3.23.43
- Geant4 geant4-04-00-patch2 (the same you can get via Web)

Known bugs:
- After geant4-03-02-ref-07 release the polylines are not more rendered 
  at all on the screen if using the Geant4 OpenGL driver. To turn around
  the proto hits are drawn as dots.
- After some releases the Geant4 OpenGL driver is not more able to 
  render on the screen part of the Ecal boolean volumes. You'll get
  several warnings on the geant4 console at render time. Don't matter,
  the volumes are there!
===> This problem was officially comunnicated to the Geant4 visualization
     team with simple examples <============
