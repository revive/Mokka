 It's just a bug fix release almost concerning the LCIO interface.

  What is fixed in this Mokka release
  ===================================

  I. fixes in MCParticleList
    - to avoid double counting of parent particle if it has 
      several secondaries;
    - fixed mass and momentum from the MeV to GeV scale, as 
      it is required by LCIO.

 II. fixed energy in SimCalorimeterHit from the MeV to GeV 
     scale, as it is required by LCIO

III. fixed VHits for compiling without LCIO.
