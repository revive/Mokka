------------------------------------------------------------

I. Three small Corrections in Test Beam implementation.

models in source/Geometry/tbeam

a) Correction of the position of the scintillating tiles in the
Hcal (was wrong by 8 mm) which lead to an additional small
air gap
b) Oxygen was defined with z=16
c) The position of the Hcal as calculated in the catcher driver
was wrong by 0.115/2 mm.


II. Corrections in the Calice Ecal prototype implementation

The individual slabs of the Calice Ecal prototype are now allowed
to move out of the three structures (modules). 

As the prototype is implemented now, the slab shifts are the same 
for any configuration angle. In angular configurations only the 
three modules are shifted in such a manner that the beam enters
every module by the center of its first slab.


III. A new model for demonstration purposes

The new mokka release features a simple calorimeter model to
be used for an introduction to Mokka within the LC-Software work-
shop at DESY, Dec. 04. 

The model is called WSCal and holds as the only ingredient the
driver wscal.cc going along with the sensitive detector method 
wscalSD.cc (and the corresponding include files)


IV. New Driver for TPC
 
A new driver for the TPC (by Ties Behnke) has been added that improves
the geometry of the TPC as described in the TDR. In particular the number of 
layers is now 200 as oposed to 137.
Use new models D10 and D10scint (FeScintillatorHCal) to get the latest version
of the Tesla detector.


V. Minor bug fixes/improvements

 a) Modified  source/Kernel/GNUmakefile for sites that don't have mysql in 
    /usr/lib user need to set MYSQL_PATH.

 b) mokka.steer: 
    added comment that PythiaFileName is not yet implemented
    added /Mokka/init/lcioWriteMode WRITE_NEW/WRITE_APPEND to allow 
    overwriting of existing LCIO file

 c) ask for ending .HEPEvt or .stdhep for pythia files (was HepEvt)
