===============================================================================

Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 8.1 patch 02 and CLHEP 2.0.2.3 
   LCIO v01-05, v01-06, v01-07 or v01-08-01, gcc 3.2.3, gcc 3.4.5 or
   gcc 4.1.1, SL3 or SL4, optionally with Gear v00-04

===============================================================================

   I. Implementation of separate rotation and X and Y translation of the Calice
      Hcal and TCMT prototypes

   The separate Rotation and X and Y translations for the Hcal prototype (driver
   TBhcal05_01) and for the TCMT (driver TBcatcher05_01) were implemented. There
   are three new "global model parameters" for each of these drivers that one 
   can change in the steering file with the following commands:

	/Mokka/init/globalModelParameter HcalTranslateX -20.0
	/Mokka/init/globalModelParameter HcalTranslateY 500.0
	/Mokka/init/globalModelParameter HcalRotationAngle 12.5

	/Mokka/init/globalModelParameter TCMTTranslateX -20.0
	/Mokka/init/globalModelParameter TCMTTranslateY 500.0
	/Mokka/init/globalModelParameter TCMTRotationAngle 12.5

   Please note that the parameters "HcalRotationAngle" and "TCMTRotationAngle"
   should be used to set the rotation, instead of the previous parameter 
   "configuration_angle" that was used by the old models to set the overall 
   configuration angle of all detectors. This old parameter still exists in the 
   DB in order to allow users of previous models to set the angle.


II. Implementation of Drift Chambers with separate X and Y sensitivity
    for the Desy May 2006 setups.

    For the Desy tb, the 'real' drift chambers give a separate measurement of 
    the X and Y position of the hits: in particular, the first half of each 
    chamber (along the beam axis) gives the position of the hits in X and the 
    second half gives the Y position. In Mokka v06-03p01 the chambers are 
    simulated with a single gas volume and therefore the generated hits have 
    an (X,Y,Z) position at each point of the chamber. In order to make the 
    simulation as close as possible to the reality, Fabrizio re-wrote the 
    drivers for the Desy chambers in such a way that each chamber is now made 
    of 2 separate (but contiguous) gas volumes (of the same gas type, mixture, 
    pressure and temperature). In total the gas volumes are therefore 8 
    (2xchambers).

    The folowing new models were implemented, with a separate X and Y 
    sensitivity of Drift Chambers:

    - TBDesy0506_dchxy: same as TBDesy0506 but with DCH's having separate
      X and Y sensitivity (8 hits collections)

    - TBDesy0506_01_dchxy: same as TBDesy0506_01 but with separate X and Y
      sensitivity of the DCH's (8 hits collections)



III. Implementation of drift chambers having a unified hit collection
     for the 2006 setups. Renaming of 2006 DCH's.

     One more improvement of 2006 TB models done by Fabrizio is regarding the 
     collections of hits for both Desy and Cern. Since the number of drift 
     chambers available at Desy and Cern (and possibly at Fnal later on) is 
     different, having one collection of hits per chamber in the MC (so 4 
     collections at Desy, 3 at Cern, XX at Fnal) could be a problem when the 
     hits are later digitized in the reconstruction. Therefore in the new 
     drivers for the Desy tb and Cern tb there is now only one collection of 
     hits that 'collects' all the hits from all the chambers and the chamber 
     (or volme, in the Desy case) that corresponds to a given hit is identified 
     by the parameter cellID in the SimTrackerHit collection. For Desy the 
     cellID map is the following:

     DC1 -> layer 0 (X), 1 (Y)
     DC2 -> layer 2 (X), 3 (Y)
     DC3 -> layer 4 (X), 5 (Y)
     DC4 -> layer 6 (X), 7 (Y)

     For facilitating the digitization and the tracking, DC1 and DC2 at Desy and
     DC3 and DC1 at Cern have been swapped, so that DC1 is always the one 
     closer to the Ecal (and then 2, 3, (4) are those further and further away 
     from it).

     The folowing new models were defined in the DB:

     - TBDesy0506_dchxy_new: same as TBDesy0506_dchxy but with only one hits
       collection in the DCH's
     - TBDesy0506_01_dchxy_new: same as TBDesy0506_01_dchxy but with only one 
       hits collection in the DCH's
 
     - TBCern0806_dchxy_new: same as TBCern0806 but only one hits collection
       in the DCH's
     - TBCern0806_01_dchxy_new: same as TBCern0806_01 but only one hits
       collection in the DCH's

     - TBCern1006_dchxy_new: same as TBCern1006 but only one hits collection
       in the DCH's
     - TBCern1006_01_dchxy_new: same as TBCern1006_01 but only one hits
       collection in the DCH's


  IV. New steering command for initializing the seed of the random engine.

      A new steering command was added to allow initialization of the random 
      engine with a single seed:

      /Mokka/init/randomSeed 12345

      Geant4 provides an alternate way that can be used to initialize the random
      engine by specifying a whole state in a file and then passing it to the
      Geant4/CLHEP random number generator.
