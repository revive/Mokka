===============================================================================

Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.0.p01 and CLHEP 2.0.3.1
   LCIO v01-05, v01-06, v01-07, v01-08-01 or v01-09 (recommended), 
   gcc 3.2.3, gcc 3.4.5 or
   gcc 4.1.1, SL3 or SL4, optionally with Gear v00-07 (recommended)

===============================================================================

   I. Fixes in SEcal02 driver

      Fixed bug which let to bad z values for hits in end caps.


  II. New EcalBarrelPreShowerCollection and EcalEndcapPreShowerCollection
      hit collections.

      To avoid troubles for the current reconstruction codes, the
      hits in the new first layer from IP in this new Ecal driver, 
      the one before the first radiator one, are registered in two
      new hit collections: EcalBarrelPreShowerCollection for hits in
      this first layer in barrel and EcalEndcapPreShowerCollection,
      the same concerning the Ecal end caps.


 III. Field for LDC01_05Sc

      Following the discussions in the ILD-optimization meeting, the field
      for LDC01_05Sc is switched back to simple Sfield01 one to obtain
      better CPU time performances in simulation tasks.

 IV. Improved conversion of stdhep to lcio::MCParticle/LCEvent

     - if present in the stdhep file the event weight is copied to the LCEvent::getWeight 
       attribute

     - if present the "idrup" user process id is copied to the LCEvent::parameter("_idrup")

     - if built with LCIO the LCStdHepRdr and lStdHep classes from LCIO are used
       ( removed additional copy of LcStdHepRdr ) 
 

 V.  GEAR interface modifications:
     - VXD00 now reports 0 ladders per layer to flag that is not actually
       creating ladders, but only cylinders. The ladder width is set to the
       cylinder circumference.


 VI. LCal hit positions now global
     the position of the LumiCal hits is now the global position 
     in x,y,z (used to be rho,phi,z in 'local' coordinates (w/o x-angle)

 VII. Created a new TPC Mokka Driver: TPC06, and sensitive detector stepping routine for the TPC: TPCSD02.
      Gone back to the pad-row approach previously used, to ensure that hits that are created lie on the 
      "measurement planes" of the TPC, in this case the central radius of the pad-rows. This ensures that 
      no bias will be passed on to the digitiser.   

      These "measured hits" have been augmented with additional space-point hits, at intervals limited by 
      the user-defined step-length limit, which has been increased from 5mm to 10mm . These additional 
      space point hits are only present in large gaps between measured hits where the track traverses the 
      pad ring at a shallow angle. These hits have been placed into a separate Hit collection and have their 
      dE/dx value set to zero, all the energy deposited in a pad ring is stored in the "measured hits" placed 
      at the central radius of the pad rows.

VIII. Apply crossing angle boost to MCParticles
     
     If a boost is applied with the command
     /Mokka/init/lorentzTransformationAngle alpha 
     alpha: half the crossing angle
     the boost wasn't applied to the MCParticle collection written out.
     This has been fixed.
