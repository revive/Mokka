===============================================================================

   I. Three new Test Beam models for the Cern 2007 experiment
  
      Three new models for the test beam setups of Jully and August 2007
      Cern experiments were implemented: 

	-TBCern07 : theoretical model, with the ideal Ecal - fully instrumented
	-TBCern0707 : Ecal with all slabs present, but the bottom front 6 
	-TBCern0807 : Ecal with all slabs present, but the bottom front 3, 
		with the remaining 3 alveolae instrumented with the 'fake' 
		tungsten slabs
 
   I. a) Thanks to Fabrizio Salvatore, we have new drivers for beam detectors 
      in the 2007 test beam models (in the following, a brief description of 
      the changes with respect to the 2006 test beam models are given):

   - Cerenkov detector: no changes wrt TB06 model
   - Drift chambers: no changes wrt TB06 model
   - Scintillators: only 3 scintillators on the beam line (2 10x10cm2
                    beam trigger and (one 20x20cm2 for muon trigger)
   - Veto: added on the beam line a 100x100cm2 scintillator, with a
           20x20cm2 hole in the centre, corresponding to the position of
           the 20x20cm2 scintillator.
   - muon chambers: only one muon chamber is simulated, at the back of
                    the TCMT

   I b) Thanks to Guilherme Lima, we have a new implementation of the TCMT:

   - new feature: staggering of the sensitive TCMT layers, cf.
     the prototype used at CERN in July-August 2007.
   - The sizes of the TCMT absorbers have been enlarged, for a
     better match to the real dimensions. 

   I c) Thanks to Oliver Wendt, a new version of the Hcal is available, with
        the following features:

	1. Rotation and Staggering of the CALICE analog HCAL

	With this release it is possible to rotate and stagger the analog HCAL 
	in the models  TBCern07, TBCern0707 and TBCern0807. This is done to 
	simulate non perpendicular beam incidence. The rotation and staggering 
	can be choosen by the detector setup, e.g. TB30 for a rotation of 30 
	degrees.  Additionally, it is possible to rotate the HCAL as a bulk 
	with the global model parameter HcalRotationAngle. This is done to 
	handle misalignments.

	2. Position and Number of Layers for the CALICE analog HCAL

	The number of layers is set to 38 for the detector models TBCern07, 
	TBCern0707 and TBCern0807. Additionally, the position of the analog 
	HCAL is adjusted to reflect the situation during data taking in 2007 
	at CERN.


  II. New PostConstructAction() method for VSubDetectorDriver

      Super drivers (drivers which are able to scale) which would
      not need to create temporary databases on the fly (not
      really using old detector drivers) should be able to 
      propagate the geometry scaling results for subsequent
      drivers being built. To provide this functionality, a new
      virtual method is added to the VSubDetectorDriver
      abstract interface:

      virtual G4bool 
            PostConstructAction(CGAGeometryEnvironment&);

      This method is called after the sub-detector construction
      and the CGAGeometryEnvironment object passed as parameter
      is bypassed for the next drivers. By default it returns true.


VIII. New steering commands for test beam data information storing

      Two new steering commands were added that allow users of test beam
      simulation to store in the LCIO run header the DataRunNumber and the
      DataConfiguration of the data run corresponding to the simulation
      run:

	/Mokka/init/confDataTag
	/Mokka/init/dataRunNumber 

 III. New SEcal02 super detector driver

      This new super driver is part of the new LDC baseline
      being built. In this new Ecal implementation, the sensitive 
      Si are build as wafers placed in towers (2 wafers per alveolus), 
      so it could be useful for people studding the resolution 
      degradation created by the fiber gaps and guard rings. The 
      endcaps are better implemented avoiding booleans, so it should 
      be faster at run time.
      A complete documentation will be provided for the next release.

 
  IV. New SHcal03 super detector driver

      This new super driver is part of the new LDC baseline
      being built. This new Hcal implementationit's almost the same as 
      before, but with just 3 modules in the barrel stave and the rings 
      plugged on the end caps. 
      A complete documentation will be provided for the next release.

   V. New driver_default_value field in models03.sharing table

      As new super drivers often reuse old parameters shared by
      previous super drivers, but with a new value as default, the
      new field driver_default_value was created for the
      models03.sharing table. If this field is not equal to NULL,
      the actual value overwrites the old one in the database;
      otherwise the parameter takes the old default value.

  VI. New model_status field in models03.model table

      As new models can be unstable for a while, the time to
      put all pieces together and tune the parameters, the new
      field model_status in models03.model table can now be used
      to flag it. For the moment this field can receive the values
      'frozen', for models good for production, or 'unstable',
      for models being developed. In the future this field will
      be also useful to flag obsolete models, which are no more
      supported by Mokka. 

      For the moment, if a model is not frozen, the user is
      warmed about there isn't any warring concerning the stability
      of the simulation results.

 VII. Daughter visibility set to false for yoke03 driver

      To display all muon chambers installed inside the yoke take a 
      lot of time. To provide a faster display for models using this
      geometry driver, the daughter visibility are now set to 
      false for all the vis attributes of its main volumes.

  IX. GEAR interface improvements

      All HCAL drivers write an additional parameter
      Hcal_virtual_cell_size, which is required by the MokkaCaloDigi
      processor in MarlinReco. By default, this virtual cell size is set
      to the actual cell size of the HCAL.
      The pad height in TPC drivers tpc00-tpc03 is now rounded off to
      the next smallest micron. This is needed to avoid problems in Marlin,
      where due to rounding errors the number of pad rows times the pad height
      was seen to extend slightly beyond the actual pad area.
