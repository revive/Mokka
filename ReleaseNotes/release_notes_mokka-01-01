What is new in this new Mokka release
=====================================

I) New detector model "D09"
---------------------------

1) The new detector model "D09", which should become the Mokka
reference model for a while. It's composed by:

 o tube00 - the beam tube with also the VXD cables around;

 o Inner tracking detectors :
   o vxd00 - the vertex detector
   o sit00 - Si intermediate Tracker
   o ftd00 - forward tracking disks

   * All the inner tracking detectors keep hits in the new
   tracking standard hit format (see below).

 All the tube and the inner tracking detector dimensions and materials
 come from the Brahms geometry description data. It should be almost
 the same we can have with Brahms today.

 o tpc03 - the TPC as 137 * ~ 1 cm Ar disks and with the new
           tracking standard hits format (see below). Moreover,
       the FCH disks are now in Si. See also "New line command
           parameter -t value" below, special for for people studying a
       particular TPC readout.

 o calorimeters:
   o ecal02 - the standard Si/W Ecal since the TDR model
   o hcalFeRPC1 - the Hcal digital built in Iron and with RPCs

 o mask02 - the W masks moved 1m out, with new angle to take in
            account the new position and the local electronics.
            
 o field01, yoke00 and coil00 - the magnetic field, the return yoke
   and the coil as before, for the D08 model



2) New tracking standard hits format

  All the inner tracking detectors and the new tpc01 driver keep hits
the same hit format, the "Mokka tracking standard hit format". For
each sub detector and for each event the user should find on the disk a
file with, one hit per line, the format:

  Layer  X  Y  Z   Px  Py  Pz   PID  PDG  E

where:
Layer : the layer number
X  Y  Z : "hit" point (the layer middle point when crossing)
Px  Py  Pz : momentum
PID : primary particle id in the Pythia file
PDG :  particle type (electron, positron, etc), it can be not the
       primary type if it's one of its secondaries.
E : the total energy deposited by the PID particle or one of
       its secondaries.

special driver remarks:
vxd00 : layers are 1 to 5
sit00 : layers are 1 or 2
ftd00 : layer is in reality the disk number,
        1 to 7 for Z>0,
       -7 to -1 for Z<0
tpc03 : layers are 1 to 137 for the gas rings,
        1000 for the FCH at Z>0
        1001 for the FCH ar Z<0


3) New tracking standard sensitive detector

   All the inner tracking detectors and the new tpc01 driver share
the same "sensitive detector" (in the Geant4 sense), the TRKSD00
one. This sensitive detector is able to collect the new tracking
standard hits as described above depending on the Energy threshold
given as a constructor parameter. For Si the actual implementation
sets the value is 20% of a MIP as threshold; for the TPC gas the
threshold is 31.5192 * eV.

  Moreover, the TRKSD00 sensitive detector is driven also by the
constructor parameter "primary Energy Cut", set to zero as default.
It's useful for the TPC driver to avoid huge output files, see below.


4) New line command parameter -t <double>:

  This new line command parameter specifies the TPC primary energy cut
in MeV. The default is 10 MeV to avoid TPC huge output files. Setting it
to zero enable users studding the TPC particular readouts to save on
disk all hits with more than the 2*Mips threshold in the gas.


II) Geant4 physics list
-----------------------

 Thanks to the Geant4 Hadronic Physics Working group, a set of
major use-cases of geant4 hadronic physics list are now available
at "The home page of the geant4 Hadronic Physics Working group"
(http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/~hpw/GHAD/HomePage/). Mokka is concerned
by the "High energy physics calorimetry list (LHEP)" use-case
(http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/~hpw/GHAD/HomePage/lists/LHEP/index.html).

 The LHEP contents is almost the same the physics list in use in 
the old Mokka releases. It means, the physics simulation quality 
with Mokka releases has been quite good if taking as reference the 
Geant4 Hadronic Physics Working group advices (a big thanks to
Hans-Peter Wellisch discussing it with us). To keep the Mokka physics 
standard and referenced also for the future this new Mokka release 
adopts the official LHEP physics list. 

 The LHEP relies in a Physics Packaging library and the all should 
become officially part of the Geant4 distribution in the future. For 
the moment it's a independent package to be installed by the users. 
To avoid users to dealing with these independent packages, the LHEP and 
Packaging code are for the moment together with the Mokka sources. It
means, Mokka users aren't concerned by these changes because
the LHEP and Packaging sources are now merged in the include and src
Mokka directories. You'll see a lot off "G4*" new files in these 
directories, it should be cleaned in the future when these packages 
will be officially part of the Geant4 distribution.


III) Magnetic field scalar factor
---------------------------------

 The new command line parameter "-B <double>" enables the user to
apply an overall scaling factor (0. to 1., defaults 1.) to the 
magnetic field map, if any. It implements the following user 
request: 

 "Actually I wanted to set the field to zero for test purposes. I 
could imagine that a run-time option to allow one to apply an 
overall scaling factor to the standard field map might be a useful 
general facility." by David Ward.

Remarks: the magnetic field is a special geometry driver detector 
which can be set or not when compounding a detector model. Moreover, 
the actual field00 driver reads the field map from the given database
at launch time. So the correct way to change the magnetic field map
keeping traces for the future analysis should be to fill a new 
field map database and to launch a new detector model using it. By 
the way, to implement a special user request, the new command line 
parameter "-B <double>" can be used for tests.


IV) G4BooleanSolid local code
-----------------------------

  The Geant4 release 4.1 introduces the deletion of all the
G4VSolid stored objects when executing the "exit" command.
In the case of G4BooleanSolid solids the object is deleted
twice! This bug, already communicated to the Geant4 developers
Team, can generate a segment fault in some cases. To avoid
this segment fault (and a big core dump...) when leaving,
a fixed copy of the G4BooleanSolid.cc file is now placed
in the Mokka distribution set and included in the main 
program to force the linkage. 

 It's almost a cosmetic turn around. There aren't reasons to 
believe that such bug could compromise the simulation results.



=====================================
To be done:
==========
(just to not forget and not in this order)

1) Mokka Kernel
- particleGun: the user should be able to shoot the same particle
  with the same energy but with random directions inside a solid
  angle;

- review for the Control class: it should be implemented as 
  singleton and to keep the actual static members as attributs

2) Persistency

- to implement the Root Tree file format option;
- to implement the SIO file format option.

3) Simple Event Display

- to implement track and hits selection commands for display.
- to implement sub-detector selection command for display.
- to implement run time color selection commands.
- to implement a graphic interface to short cut the Geant4 
  visualization commands syntax.

Dependencies:
 This Mokka release was tested with the following environments:
- Linux Red Hat 6.2 and Linux Red Hat 7.3
- gcc 2.95.2 and 2.95.3
- MySQL 3.23.43
- Geant4 release geant4-04-01-ref-03

Known bugs:
- After geant4-03-02-ref-07 release the polylines are not more rendered 
  at all on the screen if using the Geant4 OpenGL driver. To turn around
  the proto hits are drawn as dots.
- After some releases the Geant4 OpenGL driver is not more able to 
  render on the screen part of the Ecal boolean volumes. You'll get
  several warnings on the geant4 console at render time. Don't matter,
  the volumes are there!
===> This problem was officially comunnicated to the Geant4 visualization
     team with simple examples <============
