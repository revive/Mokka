===============================================================================

Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 8.1 patch 02 and CLHEP 2.0.2.3 
   LCIO v01-05, v01-06, v01-07 or v01-08-01, gcc 3.2.3, gcc 3.4.5 or
   gcc 4.1.1, SL3 or SL4, optionally with Gear v00-03

2. Due to the new definition of the materials, it doesn't work with
   Geant4 releases older than 8.1 any more.

===============================================================================

I. Fetching MySQL Fields by Index

    The methods "Database::fetchDouble", "Database::fetchInt", and
    "Database::fetchString" can now address fields in the result of a MySQL
    command not only by name, but also by index (starting from zero).

    The order of the fields is given either by the order in the corresponding
    "SELECT" statement or by the order of fields in the table definition (in
    the case of "SELECT *"). Other commands may produce one or more columns of
    output as well -- see the MySQL documentation or try the commands out
    interactively in the MySQL monitor.

    This extension was introduced to fix the problem reported in

II. Implementation of the new coordinate system for the Test Beam
      setups of 2006

    The Calice collaboration decided to change the coordinate system of the
    2006 Test Beam setups. In the simulation the beam will be kept fixed along
    the Z axis, and only the Ecal will rotate and shift its modules according
    to the configuration angle, as specified by the detector setup at run-time.
    All other detectors are fixed.

    Three new models were implemented for the TB setups of 2006, according to
    this new coordinate system: TBDesy0506_01, TBCern0806_01 and TBCern1006_01.

    For the new CERN tb models the vacuum pipe at the exit of the Cerenkov 
    detector is also simulated.

    The simulation of deviations of the rotation angle of the Ecal from the 
    nominal values (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 45 degrees) is now possible and takes
    advantage of the fact the Ecal is the only detector that rotates in function 
    of the configuration angle.  The procedure is the following:

    The angles of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 45 degrees are specifyed by the detector 
    setup name, but one can also specify the value of the configuration angle 
    like a global parameter. Of corse, because one has also to know the shifts 
    of the Ecal modules, which have fixed values depending on the detector setup, 
    one has to also specify the setup. So, the sequence of commands would be, for 
    example:

        /Mokka/init/detectorSetup TB10
        /Mokka/init/globalModelParameter configuration_angle 12.5

    (please note that Mokka allows you to write these two steering commands in
    any order)

    At run-time, one can see that the angle has the right value, and the module 
    shifts correspond to the detector setup specified:

    ==================
    Current parameters for the ProtoCern0806_01 detector :
    - configuration_angle = 12.5
    - shift_module1 = -9.7
    - shift_module3 = 12.15
    ================== 


III. New detector models LDC00_02Sc and LDC01_02Sc

    Major changes are new VTX detector new TPC detector new instrumented yoke.
  
    TPC change - driver with step lengh limitation for accurate simulated hit 
    positioning. Hits in TPC are split in two collections in order to save 
    momentum only in one to have in the same time true information on entry and 
    exit points and no overhead in file size. Central electrode now makes a dead
    region on theta 90 degrees. Imporvements in composition and structure of the
    endplate region 
    Yoke change - new yoke now has a RPC instrumentation with for technical 
    raison cell readout with 3x3cm cell size. It will make a proper - different
    yoke geometry for LDC00 (with plug) and LDC01 (no plug). Minor correction
    to the inner radius in order to be consistent with end of HCAL.

    VXD - included the realistic vertex detector (CCD like/Tesla design) driver
    from D. Grandjean. This is a scaling driver where a number of parameters can be 
    set in the steering file. For details see:
    release_notes_mokka_05-02/XV. New Geometry Models "D14" and "D14_CMOSVTX"


IV. Fix in the Guinea-Pig Interface

    The new version of Guinea-Pig which is currently being developed at LAL
    (see the link below) produces output files with pairs (originally named
    "pairs.dat") which contain two additional values per line with some
    informational data. Since the Guinea-Pig interface of Mokka needs only the
    first seven values ("signed" energy, velocity, and vertex position), the
    possible rest of each input line (terminated by a newline character) is now
    ignored (instead of messing up the input stream).

 V. New test magnet setup TM06
    
    First implementation of DESY 5T magnet used for TPC prototype developement.
    Includes accurate magnet geometry, trigger, and a TPC with step-hit driver.
    Accurate B-field with field map. For the moment only field map for 4T with
    scaling according to the global Bfactor.
