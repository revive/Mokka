                    ===================

What is new:
===========
- A new -S <Sub detector> command line option enables the user
  to ask just a sub detector to be build without need to define
  a special model to test it. The world size is taken from the Model 
  gave with the -M command line option (the default is "TDR").
- In the GNUMakefile the default CPPFLAGS compiler flag becomes 
  -DNDEBUG. It means, several runtime self tests in the Mokka C++
  code are not more compiled, letting to a faster production 
  release.
- As discussed at the "ECAL CALICE meeting in LPNHE-X" (Dec 4, 2001),
  the Proto00 geometry driver is now able to shift upper and under 
  Si wafers in a same slab. A new parameter for the Proto00 compatible
  databases was introduced, the "wafer_shift". It express how many
  mm the Si wafer has to be shifted in both directions depending on
  if it's the upper or the under wafer layer.
  The geometry databases P55, P55Inc and P55EcalLike are up to date
  to complain with this new Proto00 geometry driver release. To keep
  backward compatibility the wafer_shift values in these databases
  were set to zero.
  A new geometry database P66 is available with a closest description
  for the current prototype project, but still to be reviewed. In 
  P66 the wafer_shift is set to 0.6 mm for tests.

- The Boolean navigation troubles turn arround mechanism is now in 
  "silent mode". To enable verbosity just set the
  -DTRACE_GEOMETRY_FAILURES CPPFLAGS compiler flag at the compilation 
   time. (BE CAREFUL: this turn arround mechanism does not work for
   Geant4 4.0 or earlier!!!!!!)

To be done:
==========
(just to not forget and not in this order)

1) Mokka Kernel
- particleGun: the user should be able to shoot the same particle
  with the same energy but with random directions inside a solid
  angle;
- VSubDetectorDriver: the concatenation of the sub detector name 
  with the true event number should be a basic service provided by
  the VSubDetectorDriver base class. The developer should no more
  be concerned with the Control::SYNCEVT kernel feature.
- Mokka should be able to provide automatic Geant4 geometry translation
  to the LC/XML format, as it's already done for Brahms/Geant3.
- As discussed at the "LC Simulation Meeting at Cern" (Nov 15-16,2001),
  Mokka should be split in two software layers, the Mokka kernel
  and a "LC Geometry facility". The "LC Geometry facility" should
  provide several API interfaces to export the same geometry 
  specifications to the reconstruction and the analyses applications.
- As discussed at the "LC Simulation Meeting at Cern" (Nov 15-16,2001),
  Mokka should provide a "Root like" data output format as an user
  option.

2) Geometry drivers
- several geometry drivers should be rewrote: TPC, FCH, masks, etc.
  Suggestions and/or voluntiers, please, send a mail to 
 
  mora@poly.in2p3.fr

- As discussed at the "ECAL CALICE meeting in LPNHE-X" (Dec 4, 2001),
  a new prototype geometry driver should be provided to enable special
  studies with the real W shape measurements.


Dependencies:
 This Mokka release was tested with the following environment:
- Linux Red Hat 6.2
- gcc 2.95.2 (but it should work without problems with early 
  releases for these libraries or the gcc version egcs-2.91.66).
- MySQL 3.23.43
- Geant4 geant4-03-02-ref-07 tag (BE CAREFUL: the Boolean turn 
  arround troubles mechanism does not work for the Geant4 4.0 
  or earlier!)

Known bugs:
- After geant4-03-02-ref-07 release the polylines are not more rendered 
  at all on the screen if using the Geant4 OpenGL driver.
- After some releases the Geant4 OpenGL driver is not more able to 
  render on the screen part of the Ecal boolean volumes. You'll get
  several warnings on the geant4 console at render time. Don't matter,
  the volumes are there!
