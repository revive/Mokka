Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.2 and CLHEP 2.0.4.2
   (and it is no more compatible with previous Geant4 versions),
   LCIO v01-11   gcc 3.2.3, gcc 3.4.5 or gcc 4.1.1, SL3 or SL4, 
   optionally with Gear v00-11-01

 I. Testbeam HCAL related changes

   Thanks to Angela Lucaci, we now have the possibility to apply Birks law and 
   time cuts on the hits collected with the TB Hcal.

   1) Birks law introduced:

   describes the attenuation of the scintillator response for densely ionising
   particles, in organic scintillator. If you want to disable it, set
   Hcal_apply_Birks_law to 0 (default is 1):
  
   /Mokka/init/globalModelParameter Hcal_apply_Birks_law 0


   2) Time cut introduced:

   only the contribution of hits which come no later than 150 nsec are saved. 
   This number was chosen by careful studies of the time dependence of the 
   HCAL hits. If you don't want to apply a time cut, set Hcal_time_cut to 0 
   (default 150 nsec):

   /Mokka/init/globalModelParameter Hcal_time_cut 0

   If you want another value, set Hcal_time_cut to your value.


II. Fix of the timing of tracker hits in Test Beam models

     The time of the hits in the sensitive detector TBSD_Dch01 was changed 
     from the proper time to the global time. 


III. Fix of CarbonFiber material definition for Calice Ecal prototypes

    The fractions of mass of the components of the Carbon Fiber material 
    in Calice Ecal prototypes were corrected. The old definition of this 
    material induced a radiation length increase from 286 mm (the correct 
    value) to 291 mm, and of the nuclear interaction length from 515 mm 
    (the correct value) to 546 mm. The fixes were done to the drivers 
    Proto03, Proto04, Proto04_01, Proto04_02 and Proto05. Daniel Jeans 
    kindly offered to analyze the effect of this correction in model 
    TBCern0806_01_dchxy_new, with 10GeV electrons, and he noticed that there 
    are very small effects on the longitudinal profile.
