                             =======================


What is new in this Mokka release
=================================

- started to addressed issue with MCParticles from calorimeter showers stored in LCIO file:
  commented out SetToBeSaved()  in Control::GetPIDForCalHit()
  - much less shower particles will be added
  - we still get neutrons that cause hits in other parts of the calorimneter
  use 
    /Mokka/init/lcioWriteParentsForBackscatter false 
  to activate new treatment ( experimental - needs checking)




- TRKSiSD00 -- Corrected the storing of the MCParticle responsible for TrackerHits to reflect the way it is done for the other tracking detectors. 
  	       It was previously following the old Calo style from which the code was originally branched. 

- TPC10     -- Corrected parameter reading for dz_Readout which was incorrectly read as dz_Endplate, 
               which lead to a 75mm section of gas being placed behind the readout instead of infront. 
               Corrected copy number of cathode, was 1 in places and should have been 0.  

- ParticleGunGenerator -- Added Uniform Smearing for momentum over a defined interval, smearing values mean half the width.
                       -- Use /gun/momentumSmearingMode uniform 


- SHcalSc03 : changed to slightly rounded outer edges in the barrel to follow the engineering model (Sh.Lu)

- the beamcal driver has been switched back to the new BeamCal08
- a 1mm air gap has been added to the AHcal
- switched back the treatment of MCParticles in the calorimeter to
  the old behavior, where parents of back scattered particles are stored...

- implemented services for internal detectors in all three options of ILD models
- changed thicknesses of Al beam pipe sections modeling services
