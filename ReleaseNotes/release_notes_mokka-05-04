=====================================================================

Please note:

 1. Due to a series of bug fixes, the models03 database of
    the central MySQL server was changed, so users having local databases
    should update them from the central server on pollin1.in2p3.fr.

 2. This Mokka release was tested with Geant4 7.1-patch01, LCIO v01-05
    and v01-06, gcc 3.2.3, CLHEP 1.9.1.2.

=====================================================================

I. Fixes of overlaps on the scaling models

 1. A new "Ecal_endcap_zmax" parameter was introduced to avoid endcap
    overlaps between Ecal and Hcal. This parameter is set by the Ecal
    SEcal01 driver with the zmax value of the Ecal endcap. The SHcal01
    driver takes it in account when placing the Hcal endcap. A gap of
    0.5 mm is hard coded to avoid spurious geometry overlap warnings.

 2. An overlap between the Yoke and the Mask was removed by increasing
    parameter Yoke_endcap_inner_radius from 235 mm to 240.5 mm in table
    parameters of database models03.

 3. A 0.5 mm gap was hardcoded in driver FTD00 in order to avoid a spurious
    overlap warning in sub-detector FTD01.

 4. Another gap of 0.5 mm has been introduced in the driver ftd00 to avoid a
    geometry overlap error in the subdetectors ftd00 and ftd01.

 5. The drivers vxd00 and vxd01 have been fixed to avoid geometry overlap
    errors in the cryostats of the subdetectors vxd00 and vxd01.

 6. The driver for the LumiCal has been modified slightly to avoid a spurious
    waring message about overlapping geometries. The actual geometry has not
    been changed.


II. Fixed tracker_region_zmax to include all region inside the Ecal

    The responsibility to change the tracker region parameters as the detector
    model scale becomes now to the SEcal01 driver. The tracker_region_rmax is
    always set to the current value from TPC_outer_radius, as before, but
    thanks to this change the tracker_region_zmax becomes the Ecal endcap's
    inner boundary z value.


III. Mokka can handle any suspended tracks

    Mokka doesn't abort any more if a not back scattering track is suspended.
    This enables the users to use nuclear reactions processes in the physics
    list without crashes.


IV. G4Transportation patch

    In the last Geant4 public release (7.1-patch01) the G4Transportation
    process has a bug which lets to a bad navigation when resuming suspended
    tracks. It's described as problem report #820 at the "Geant4 Problem
    tracking system", at http://pcitapiww.cern.ch/asdcgi/geant4/problemreport
    /show_bug.cgi?id=820.
    This Mokka release provides a patched G4Transportation as workaround this
    problem, when waiting for an official fix. It's included in the Mokka.cc
    thanks to a #include directive.
    It co-works only with geant4-07-01-patch-01, so as soon as you install a
    new Geant4 release you have to comment the #include directive above.


V. Implemented Print Level for Mokka messages.

    A print level was implemented in order to allow control of Mokka messages.
    It can be set by the steering command /Mokka/init/printLevel. A value equal
    to zero means no messages concerning the events processed, a value of one
    means only a line message per event, and a value greater or equal to two
    means full messages, including number of hits from all sensitive detectors.

    The warning when Mokka kills a track after 100000 steps is suppressed,
    except if Print Level is greater or equal to two.


VI. All output is sent to stdout

    (Almost) all output on the terminal is now sent to stdout, in particular
    all messages from the MySQLWrapper and from Control::Log / Control::Abort.
    In earlier versions, you could easily miss important messages (not only
    errors!) if you redirected stdout to a file, but not stderr.

    However, even though Mokka does not use stderr any more, you may still get
    messages on stderr from Geant 4 in some rare cases. In order not to miss
    anything, you can use the following to redirect both stdout and stderr to
    the same file:

        Mokka &> mokka.log    # bash
        Mokka >& mokka.log    # tcsh and bash

    Set the Print Level to a low value (see above) to avoid huge log files.


VII. Removed crash when turning sensitive detectors off.

    A crash was removed that appeared when inactivating sensitive detectors
    with the Geant 4 command: /hits/inactivate. This crash occured while
    trying to issue a message concerning the number of hits with a null pointer
    of the hits collection.


VIII. Implemented X and Y translation of Drift Chambers and Hodoscope
      of the Calice Test Beam setup

    Two new global parameters were introduced, TranslateX and TranslateY,
    that are available for the translation of the Drift Chambers and Hodoscope
    of the Calice Test Beam setup. They can be set with the command:
    /Mokka/init/globalModelParameter and should be given values consistent
    with the beam position. This new feature allows one to translate the
    upstream detectors so that they stay in the beam direction.


IX. Gave up of of field widths in superdrivers code

    Thanks to Adrian Vogel all superdrivers code are now free
    of MySQL field widths, to avoid troubles depending on the
    MySQL server version. All the superdrivers' scripts in the
    models03 database are now free of MySQL field widths, too.


X. Added printout of physics list Mokka PhysicsList, NeutronList and LCPhys


XI. Improved treatment of MCParticles in LCIO

    Fixed bugs in linking of Hits to MCParticles (by V. Morgunov and A. Zhlezov).
    Fixed problems with storage of backscattered particles (P. Krstonosic)
    Fixed a problem with double counting of energy and duplicate parent/daughter
    relations in WriteCompleteHepEvt (LCIO) mode (F. Gaede)
    Store all particles that produce hits in the tracking volume, even if they
    are below the energy cut, e.g. delta electrons. (P. Krstonosic)
	

XII. Fix for concurrent job submission and temporary databases (grid)

    Use the user variables

        /Mokka/init/userInitString TIMEOUT_TO_RELAX_TMP 120
        /Mokka/init/userInitInt SLEEP_BEFORE_RETRY 5

    to control the concurrent access to the limited number of temporary databases
    as used for the scalable detector models if you submit a lot of jobs at once.


XIII. Silicon tracker hits has now the momentum assigned in LCIO files
      if LCIO version 1.6 or higher is used


XIV. Fix for memory leak in batch jobs since geant4-07-01-ref-04

    To avoid memory leak in batch jobs since geant4-07-01-ref-04 the step
    draw option is set to false as default.


XV. Fix in the instantiation of a user interface session

    The code for the instantiation of a user interface session has been
    implemented more cleanly (using an #if-#elif-#else chain). By default, a
    "dumb" shell is created. If you want the "smart" shell (with history and
    tab completion) you have to have the environment variable G4UI_USE_TCSH
    set before compiling Mokka.cc. Other choices are the "Geant Adaptive GUI"
    (G4UI_USE_GAG) or the Xm user interface (G4UI_USE_XM), both overriding the
    smart shell in turn.
