  What is new in this Mokka release
  =================================

  This release is compliant with Geant4 release 8.0. For that several
small changes were necessary and a patch for this Geant4 release:

  I. Changes in the PhysicsLists.
 II. A patched G4PVDivision.cc.
III. A new patched G4Transportation for Geant4 8.0
 IV. Fixes in visualisation


 ====================================================================

 Please note that:

 1. This Mokka release was tested with Geant4 8.0, LCIO v01-05
    and v01-06, gcc 3.2.3, CLHEP  1.9.2.2 and 2.0.2.2

 ====================================================================


  I. Changes in the PhysicsLists:

  a) Gave up of the Mokka old PhysicsList. 

  It was the same as the official Geant4 LHEP one, so LHEP becomes the 
  default. The old PhysicsList is kept as "DummyPhysicsList" only for 
  the CGA or visualization usages, where it's used just for geometry 
  calculations.

  b) Temporarilly suspended the PhysicsListNeutrons.
  The time to adapt it to the new Geant4 physics list schema.

  c) Gave up of the PhysicsLists LHEP_GN, LHEP_HP and QGSP_GN. 
  It doesn't exist anymore in the Geant4 release 8.0.

  d) New PhisicsLists available from the Geant4 8.0 release.
  LHEP_BERT_HP, LHEP_BIC, LHEP_BIC_HP, LHEP_EMV, QGSP_BERT_HP
  and QGSP_EMV.

  c) Kernel/GNUmakefile updated to take in account the PhysicsLists
  changes.

 II. A patched G4PVDivision.cc file :

 A bug in the original G4PVDivision.cc file lets to a crash when
 using the LumicalS, see the Geant4 problem report #829. This release 
 includes a patched G4PVDivision.cc file to work around this problem. 
 It's included directly in the Mokka.cc code so the user doesn't need 
 to to patch its own Geant4 installation.

 III. A new patched G4Transportation for Geant4 8.0

 Unfortunately Geant4 8.0 doesn't fix the problem #820 so
 we provide for this Mokka release a special patch for the
 G4Transportation process. Thanks to a new G4VProcess 
 interface, this new patched G4Transportation can be
 included directly in the Mokka.cc, the user doesn't need 
 to patch its own Geant4 installation.

IV. Fixes in visualisation

 1) Fix to CalHit to be able to reload calorimeter hits even when
 it has gard ring information;
 2) Using DummyPhysicsList when in visualisation mode.
