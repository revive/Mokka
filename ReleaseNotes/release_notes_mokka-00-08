What is new in this new Mokka release
=====================================

1) The Mokka Common Access Geometry (CGA) for f77 and C programmers.
2) The Mokka "(very) Simple Event Display" (vSED).
3) New files keeping event kinetic and primaries steps in the output 
   data directory.
4) Bugs fixed in this release.

1) The Common Access Geometry (CGA) facility is released!
=========================================================

  As discussed at the "LC Simulation Meeting at Cern" (Nov 15-16,2001),
  Mokka is finally split in two software layers, the Mokka kernel
  and the Mokka Common Access Geometry (CGA) facility. The CGA is used at
  run time by the Mokka kernel. It builds and provides the interface to
  retrieve the geometry information from the Mokka database, given a
  Mokka model.

  The CGA provides right now three user API interfaces: Fortran, C++ 
  and C (the Java CGA API is comming soon).

  It should be useful for people writing reconstruction and analyses
  programs. The simulated geometry model name can be found at the first
  line from the Run.control file, in the Mokka data output directory.
  Passing it to initialize the CGA package and using CGA to access the
  geometry information insures automatically the geometry coherence
  between the simulated model and further data reconstruction and
  analyses at run time.

  Moreover, this first CGA API provides several useful services
  for reconstruction code. For example, it's able to answer how many
  X0 a given particle traverse between two given points, the volume names
  the particle passed by and so on. The interface is as open as it's
  possible and should be extended with new user requirements, if any.

  You can find the CGA documentation is in the URL

         software/doc/CGADoc/CGAIndex.html

  (A big thanks to Grabriel Mussat, a new engineer which joined us
  a few months ago at L.L.R. and wrote the CGA layer)

2) The Mokka's "(very) Simple Event Display" (vSED) is released !
=================================================================

  As announced in the last "Desy - L.L.R. software video meeting, 26th
  February 2002", Mokka implements now a simple event display. It's able
  to re-read events from the Mokka output directory to draw it,
  using the standard Geant4 visualization system and commands. To
  launch Mokka in event display mode it's enough to pass "-v" as
  command line. You have to specify the event data directory with
  the common "-o directory" option. The other command line options are
  tolerated but overridden by the Run.control file contents read from 
  the event data directory.

  To reload an event just issue the command

  /Mokka/LoadEvent <eventNumber>

  where <eventNumber> is the "xxxxxx" in the output event file names.
  (Attention: Mokka numerates the events starting from 0 !!!).

 Example:  

 /Mokka/LoadEvent  12 

 loads the files which names yyy000012.hits.

 To refresh the event on the screen just type the new command

  /Mokka/Visu/refresh

  without parameters. You have to use it each time you change the Geant4 
  view parameters, via the Geant4 standard visualization commands.

  This first release is very simple and you have to cope with the Geant4 
  native visualization commands. We advice you to use the GAG Geant4 user 
  interface to help you with the Geant standard commands. Further 
  developments should be done for this very basic event display. For 
  example to extend facilities like to select tracks and hits to be 
  drawn, etc.

3) Event kinetic and primaries step point files
===============================================

 Starting in this release Mokka writes two new ASCII files
for each simulated "xxxxxx" event number:

  o eventxxxxx.kin: keeps the event kinetics. The file format
is, for each primary, a line with:

 ID  PDG  X0  Y0  Z0  PX  PY  PZ CHARGE

 where:

 ID : the Geant4 trackID number, the same found in hits;
 PDG : the particle PDG code identifier;
 X0,Y0,Z0 : the vertex position;
 PX,PY,PZ : initial momentum;
 CHARGE : the particle charge.

 o eventxxxxx.steps: keeps the trajectories, only for primaries and
points at least 100 mm far each, to limit the disk space usage.
The file format is, for each step, a line with:
   
 ID  X  Y  Z

 where:
 ID : the Geant4 trackID number, the same as in eventxxxxxx.kin
 X,Y,Z : the step position.

 If you don't need these files, you can avoid writing it on disk
with the new  "-T" and "-P" Mokka line command options. See the new
Mokka user guide release at URL :

4) Bugs fixed in this release:
==============================

- Fixed a minor bug in hcal03 driver where the first G10 layer
  for RPCs was a half the size in the database


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
To be done:
==========
(just to not forget and not in this order)

1) Mokka Kernel
- particleGun: the user should be able to shoot the same particle
  with the same energy but with random directions inside a solid
  angle;


2) Geometry drivers
- several geometry drivers should be rewrote: TPC, FCH, masks, etc.
  Suggestions and/or voluntiers, please, send a mail to 
 
  mora@poly.in2p3.fr

Dependencies:
 This Mokka release was tested with the following environment:
- Linux Red Hat 6.2
- gcc 2.95.3 
- MySQL 3.23.43
- Geant4 geant4-04-00-patch2 

Known bugs:
- After geant4-03-02-ref-07 release the polylines are not more rendered 
  at all on the screen if using the Geant4 OpenGL driver. To turn around
  the proto hits are drawn as dots.
- After some releases the Geant4 OpenGL driver is not more able to 
  render on the screen part of the Ecal boolean volumes. You'll get
  several warnings on the geant4 console at render time. Don't matter,
  the volumes are there!
===> This problem was officially comunnicated to the Geant4 visualization
     team with simple examples <============
