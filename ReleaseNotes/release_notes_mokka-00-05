                    ===================

What is new:
===========

- Thanks to Harald Vogt (DESY), several fixes to bring the Mokka
  code strict ISO/ANSI C++ compliant. It means to use the
  qualified name namespace (std::) for each standard C++ 
  library as well as the G4xxx symbols when using the 
  G4iostream objects. Please take note for news developments.
- Cosmetic changes in the DetectorVisMessenger (not documented).
- Cosmetic changes in Proto01 and Ecal02 drivers.


To be done:
==========
(just to not forget and not in this order)

1) Mokka Kernel
- particleGun: the user should be able to shoot the same particle
  with the same energy but with random directions inside a solid
  angle;
- VSubDetectorDriver: the concatenation of the sub detector name 
  with the true event number should be a basic service provided by
  the VSubDetectorDriver base class. The developer should no more
  be concerned with the Control::SYNCEVT kernel feature.
- Mokka should be able to provide automatic Geant4 geometry translation
  to the LC/XML format, as it's already done for Brahms/Geant3.
- As discussed at the "LC Simulation Meeting at Cern" (Nov 15-16,2001),
  Mokka should be split in two software layers, the Mokka kernel
  and a "LC Geometry facility". The "LC Geometry facility" should
  provide several API interfaces to export the same geometry 
  specifications to the reconstruction and the analyses applications.
- As discussed at the "LC Simulation Meeting at Cern" (Nov 15-16,2001),
  Mokka should provide a "Root like" data output format as an user
  option.

2) Geometry drivers
- several geometry drivers should be rewrote: TPC, FCH, masks, etc.

Dependencies:
 This Mokka release was tested with the following environment:
- Linux Red Hat 6.2
- gcc 2.95.3 
- Linux Red Hat 6.2, egcs-2.91.66 at London.
- MySQL 3.23.43
- Geant4 geant4-04-00-ref-01 tag.
- Linux 4 with glibc-2.2.2-60, gcc 3.03 at DESY.

Known bugs:
- After geant4-03-02-ref-07 release the polylines are not more rendered 
  at all on the screen if using the Geant4 OpenGL driver. To turn around
  the proto hits are drawn as dots.
- After some releases the Geant4 OpenGL driver is not more able to 
  render on the screen part of the Ecal boolean volumes. You'll get
  several warnings on the geant4 console at render time. Don't matter,
  the volumes are there!
===> This problem was officially comunnicated to the Geant4 visualization
     team with simple examples <============
