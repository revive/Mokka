  What is new in this Mokka release
  =================================

 I. New detector model TB05
 II. Gaussian smearing of the starting point and momentum of the (gaussian) gun
 III. Bug fixes

--------------------------------------------------

 I. New detector model TB05
 
 Thanks to Fabrizio Salvatore from Royal Holloway College, University of London
 (p.salvatore@rhul.ac.uk), this new detector model contains, besides all sub-
 detectors from model TB04 (Ecal, Hcal and Tail Catcher), the drift chambers 
 implementation. Like in model TB04, the configuration angle is accessed
 by the means of the setup. Both ASCII and LCIO output is supported.


 II. Gaussien smearing of the starting point and momentum

 Thanks to George Mavromanolakis from University of Cambridge, Cavendish 
 Laboratory, Mokka performs gaussian smearing of gun position and momentum.
 This is useful to simulate more realistically the beam at the calice 
 testbeam which was not coming from a fixed point. The particleGun and 
 /gun/position, /run/beamOn are replaced by the commands /generator/gaussgun 
 (to give the mean xyz starting point and the respective sigmas (in mm) and 
 how many particles to shoot), and generator/gaussgun/momentum (to give the 
 momentum  and sigma in MeV/c):
 /generator/gaussgun X sigmaX Y sigmaY Z sigmaZ Nevents
 /generator/gaussgun/momentum momentum sigma
 George chose to have momentum smearing instead of energy smearing because 
 this is the correct physical process in a beamline.

 
 III. Bug fixes

 Frank Gaede from DESY (frank.gaede@desy.de) checked in two fixes:

 1. Files Mokka/source/Geometry/CGA/include(src)/MySQLWrapper.hh were changed
    allow Mokka to compile and link with MySQL 4.x

 2. In file Mokka/source/Kerne/GNUmakefile some libraries were added for
    building Mokka with granular libraries. 

 A bug was fixed in file Mokka/source/Geometry/Tesla/src/TRKSD00.cc in
 order to avoid a crash that occured very rarely while using geant4-07-00-ref-02
 due to an uninitialized pointer of the post step point physical volume.
