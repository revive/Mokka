What is new in this Mokka release 
=================================

   I. Fixing the particle charge in MCParticleList for primaries
      not tracked.
  II. Fixing memory leak when skipping events in stdhep
      input files.
 III. Bug fixes in scintillators' drivers for Desy and CERN TB models
  IV. Adding a GEAR interface to many more detector drivers.
   V. Adding new Geant4 physics lists

===============================================================================

Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.0.p01 and CLHEP 2.0.3.1
   LCIO v01-05, v01-06, v01-07 or v01-08-01, gcc 3.2.3, gcc 3.4.5 or
   gcc 4.1.1, SL3 or SL4, optionally with Gear v00-06-01

===============================================================================

   I. Fixing the particle charge in MCParticleList for primaries
      not tracked.

      Before this patch, all primaries in event file with generator
      code > 2 and all particles not tracked by Mokka had the charge
      in MCParticleList collection set to zero (not initialized).

      With this patch, all known particle in physics list have the
      charge information in the MCParticleList collection set 
      correctly. The unknown particles in the actual physics
      list have the charge set to -1000 (a not physical value).

      Many thanks to Erik Devetak signaling the problem and helping
      to fix it.

  II. Fixing memory leak when skipping events in stdhep
      input files.

      Before this fix, skipping events in stdhep input files
      have let to memory leak. For big event files Mokka could
      crashes with the runtime error "bad_alloc" (no more memory 
      available. It's fixed with this patch. Many thanks to Dennis 
      Martsch for signaling this bug in the Mokka issues tracker
      at mokka.in2p3.fr.

 III. Bug fixes in scintillators' drivers for Desy and CERN TB models

      Before this fix, an error message was printed when Mokka was
      built in 'debug' mode. The problem was in the indexing of the 
      hits in the scintillators.

  IV. Adding a GEAR interface to many more detector drivers.

      If Mokka is compiled with active GEAR interface, an xml file
      with a description of the detector geometry is created. The
      information to be put into this xml file needs to be provided
      by each individual subdetector driver. Previous versions of Mokka
      only had a small number of drivers with GEAR interface; this has
      now been extended to cover almost all Tesla and LDC models.
      Some details of the xml format were changed (for example the
      specification of the magnetic field was moved from the TPC parameter
      set into its own global section). Versions of MarlinReco newer
      than v00-04 are expected to support this new format. MarlinReco
      versions up to (and including) v00-04 will need minor manual
      editing of the xml file created by this new Mokka release.

   V. Adding new Geant4 physics lists
     
      New physics lists that became available with the recent releases of 
      Geant4 were added to Mokka PhysicsListFactory:

      FTFP_EMV, QBBC, QGSP_BERT_EMV, QGSP_BERT_NQE, QGSP_EMV_NQE, 
      QGSP_EMX, and QGSP_NQE
