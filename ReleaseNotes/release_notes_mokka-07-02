What is new in this Mokka release 
=================================
 
I.   Migration of Mokka database 

II.  Migration of the old CVS repository of Mokka

III. New sub-detector SLcal03

===============================================================================

Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.2 and CLHEP 2.0.4.2
   (but it is still compatible with previous Geant4 / CLHEP versions)
   It was tested against the latest versions of GEAR (v00-13) and
   LCIO (v01-12-pre).
   gcc 3.2.3, gcc 3.4.5 or
   gcc 4.1.1, SL3 or SL4

===============================================================================

I. Migration of Mokka database 
    
   Mokka MySQL DB was moved to a new server: polui01.in2p3.fr
   
   The old server pollin1.in2p3.fr will be stopped soon, and an alias will
   be made: polui01 will also be seen as the old server name pollin1 
   Till then, please stecify the new server name with the steering command:
   
   /Mokka/init/dbHost polui01.in2p3.fr


II. Migration of the old CVS repository of Mokka

   The CVS repository was migrated from ' pollin1.in2p3.fr ' to 
   ' llrforge.in2p3.fr ' (pollin1 will be stopped).

   The old Mokka releases can be downloaded from the new CVS repository, 
   via the (readonly) account ' anoncvs '. The CVSROOT should be set to

   :pserver:anoncvs@llrforge.in2p3.fr:/home/cvs/Ilc

   (the password is unchanged).

III. New sub-detector SLcal03

   Thanks to Bogdan Pawlik, we now have a new implementation of the LumiCal
   sub-detector 'SLcal03'. This new implementation can be used, for example
   by specifying model ILD_00 and replacing the old LumiCal with the new one.
   For that, the following commands can be used in the steering file:

   /Mokka/init/detectorModel ILD_00
   /Mokka/init/EditGeometry/rmSubDetector SLcal02
   /Mokka/init/EditGeometry/addSubDetector SLcal03  100

   (the last number on the last line above (100) is the build order, and 
    is the same for all ILD_00 - like models).
