  What is new in this Mokka release
  =================================

I.   Timing output in LCIO files, and a new CellId decoding for tbeam 
     (thanks to Frank Gaede)

II.  New detector model CaliceEcal03 for the Calice ecal prototype
     (Gabriel Musat)

III. New method CGAGetCellID of the CGA interface
     (Gabriel Musat)

IV.  Oval test files added
     (thanks to David Chamont)




I.   Timing output in LCIO files, and a new CellId decoding for tbeam 

 1) Added timing to SimCalorimeterHit and SimTrackerHit in 'standard' simulations,
    e.g. D09, tbeam02,...

 2) For calorimeter hits the detailed timing (one entry per secondary!) is obtained with
    the command: /Mokka/init/lcioDetailedShowerMode = true
    only available with LCIO files - the Ascii output is not changed 

 3) decoding of cellids in tbeam changed to be   I: 0x00ff0000 , J : 0x0000ff00 , K: 0x000000ff


II.  New detector model CaliceEcal03 for the Calice ecal prototype

 1) The new ecal prototype has 
	- three independent modules of 1.4, 2.8 and 4.2 mm Tungsten
	  (modules 1 and 2 can be independently shifted along the X axis,
	   with shifts specified in the database, when we are testing
	   angular configurations)
	- six sensitive wafers (upper tower is empty - filled with air)
	- slabs can be independently shifted in X direction
	- first wafer layer of every slab can be shifted in X direction
	- wafers physically divided in cells
	- guard-rings divided in virtual zones
	(for a more detailed explanation see document at http://polype.in2p3.fr/geant4/tesla/www/mokka/ProtoDoc/CoordinatesAndNumbering.html)

 2) The new ecal has CGA method CGACellIndex implemented 
	(see doc in Mokka/doc/CGADoc)

 3) The new ecal has a new output format for ASCII files - energy deposits
	in different guard-ring zones were added at the end of the 
        entry of the touched calorimeter cell:

      The output file format for Calice ecal becomes for each line:
 
      P   WI   WJ   I   J   K   X   Y   Z   E  CellId CGAFLAG nPID E1 E2 ... En

     where
     P = detector piece number:
     WI = Wafer index in X direction (WI >= 1)
     WJ = Wafer index in Y direction (WJ >= 1)
     I,J = the cell coordinates in the cells matrix ( I, J >= 1)
     K = Sensitive (Si) layer number (K >= 1)
     X,Y,Z = the cell center in world coordinates
     E = the total energy deposited in the cell by the PID particle and
        its secondaries.
     CellId = encoded cellId (for CGA)
     CGAFLAG = internal CGA flag (for CGA)
     nPID = number of primary particle partial contributions following
           this line
     E1, E2, ..., En = The energy deposits in the guard-ring virtual zones
		       1, 2, ..., n (n is specified in the database)
	 
     Just following each cell summary line, nPID details are written with 
     the PID partial contributions, with the format :

     PID  EPID  nPDG

    where
    PID = primary particle id in the Pythia file.
    EPID = partial energy contribution from this PID to this cell
    nPDG = number of PDG partial contributions following
           this line.

    and nPDG lines with the format :

     PDG  EPDG

    where
    PDG = particle type (electron, positron, etc)
    EPDG = partial PDG energy contribution from the above PID.


III. New method CGAGetCellID of the CGA interface
     
     - implemented only for the new Calice ecal prototype
     - takes the (x, y, z) coordinates of a point as argument
     - returns the compressed index of the cell
     (see Mokka/doc/CGADoc)

IV.  Oval test files added
     Two oval test files were added in 
	Mokka/source/test and 
	Mokka/source/Geometry/Calice/test
     These two tests check if models D09M1 and CaliceEcal03 run all right
