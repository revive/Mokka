  What is new in this Mokka release
  ===================================

  I. compatibility with the Geant4 release 6.0

	The standard physics list is part of the standard
     Geant4 distribution since the release 6.0. For these 
     reason the include and the src directories in the LHEP 
     and Packaging directories become software links to the
     standard Geant4 ones. The GNUMakefile automatically
     update such links to provide compatibility for new
     Geant4 releases in the future.
