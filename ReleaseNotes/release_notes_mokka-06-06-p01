                             =======================

What is new in this Mokka release 
=================================

   I.  New steering commands available to change FieldManager parameters

   II. New FTD self scaling FTD Driver SFtd03

===============================================================================

Please note that:

1. This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.1.p02 and CLHEP 2.0.3.2
   (but it is still compatible with previous Geant4 / CLHEP versions)
   LCIO v01-05, v01-06, v01-07, v01-08-01 or v01-09 (recommended),
   gcc 3.2.3, gcc 3.4.5 or
   gcc 4.1.1, SL3 or SL4, optionally with Gear v00-08-02

===============================================================================

   I.  New steering commands available to change FieldManager parameters
 
   Two new steering commands were implemented to change the parameters
   DeltaIntersection and DeltaOneStep of the FieldManager:
   They can be used in the steering file, like, for example:

   /Mokka/init/userDeltaIntersection 3e-5 mm
   /Mokka/init/userDeltaOneStep 3e-4 mm

   II. New FTD self scaling FTD Driver SFtd03

   It is a self scaling driver where the z positions of the disks are set 
   relative to the length of the TPC and the inner radius of the disks are 
   calculated as a function of the beamtube opening angle.  

   The TUBE_opening_angle is used, though this does not affect the actual 
   beam tube in Mokka, as that does not take this value as a parameter, 
   nor does it attempt to set it. The actual opening angle of the section 
   of the beam tube lying directly under the FTD in the Mokka model 
   LDC01_06Sc has a tangent of 0.07876. As the value of TUBE_opening_angle 
   will be set to 0.092 the FTD will not suffer any geometric overlap with
   the beam tube and the inner radii will be of the desired size, not a 
   great solution but at least safe for now.

   There are values for cable shield thickness, cable thickness and 
   outer support cylinder thickness in the Database.
