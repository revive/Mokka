                    ===================
 
  What is new in this Mokka release
  ===================================

  I.  Fixed calo hits in the LCIO files to be in GeV instead of MeV.
 II.  New Ecal prototype driver proto02.
III.  New ProtoEH_RPC prototype model.
 IV.  New BeginOfEventAction method for VSubDetectorDriver interface.


  I. Fixed calo hits in the LCIO files to be in GeV instead of MeV:
  
  Just a bug fix in Mokka code.

 II. New Ecal prototype driver proto02:

  This just a few changes in the proto01 driver to allow a better 
geometry description of the actual Ecal prototype being build. It
allows a odd number of wafers in the slabs, the material mixture
describing the electronic PCB is almost realistic, the main prototype
dimensions are almost good. It co-works with the new ProtoEH_RPC
model.

III.  New ProtoEH_RPC prototype model.

  It's the same ProtoEcalHcalRPC configuration ("the Ecal prototype 
and a single Hcal RPC module as Hcal prototype") in it's "vertical"
slab placement version, but using the new proto02 driver. It means, 
with a better geometry description of the actual Ecal prototype 
being build. To be better described soon, in the Mokka Web page.

 IV.  New BeginOfEventAction method for VSubDetectorDriver interface.

  This new method allows the geometry driver to be called at the
beginning of the event, if needed:

    virtual void BeginOfEventAction(const G4Event*) {};
