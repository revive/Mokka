                             =====================

What is new in this Mokka release
=================================


  - F.Gaede: made compatible with SL6 and geant4 9.6
    - use namespace mokka for NONE to avoid ambiguities in Control.cc
    - removed obsolete QGSP_INCL_ABLA physics list from PhysicsListFactory

  - D.Jeans: new SEcal05/SEcalSD04 with layer-by-layer hybrid configuration; scalable endcap geom 

  - B.Vormwald: extra particles are treated as stable if width==0.

  - S.Lu: Added two parameters for TBcatcher drivers.And apply Birks law for the Tcmt scintillator and the time cut for Tcmt hits.

  - S.Lu: Added Plugin ShowerDecomposition for AHCAL testbeam model.

  - S.Lu: Added new physics list from GEANT4.9.6: FTFP_BERT_HP.


  - S.Aplin: Added TrackingPhysicsList. This is a simplified physics list which allows the energy loss and multiple scattering to 
    turned on and off via steering commands.  
    It should not be used for physics studies, but simply to enable track resolution studies to be made with and without material
    effects.

  - S.Aplin: Allow DataRunNumber and mcRunNumber to be set via Command Line

  - S.Lu: Update hcal test beam SD drivers, And add detailed MC contributions Step Position information into hit:
          - TBSD_VCell03.cc/TBSD_VCell04.cc
    Create a flexible hcal driver for the next generation hcal prototype, to study both the space and timing, 4 
    dimensions information
         -TBhcal4d.cc, TBSD_VCell4d.cc


  - S.Aplin: Added command line option for setting random seed value 
    -r <seed>  specifies the random seed. Overides any value specified in the steering file.
    The value of the random seed is now printed out at the beginning of a run.

    - added random seed value to lcio run header
