                             ===================

   This release is aimed to be a status report of the SDHcal implementation
   in Mokka.

   
   Briefly, there are two drivers, SHcalRpc01 (following the geometry design
   suggested by Henri Videau) and SHcalRpc02 (the Tesla geometry where
   scintillators are replaced with RPC's). They both have not only the Barrel
   BUT also the EndCaps and the EndCapRings fully equipped with the same model 
   of RPC's (the driver SHcalRpc02 being also able to build scintillators
   if specified in the steering file).  For both drivers, in the EndCaps and 
   Rings there is a layer of thick glass, the gas gap, a layer of thin glasss 
   (these have the same thickneses as those in the Barrel), and the rest is a 
   mixture (electronics, PCB, etc...). There also are no spacers in the 
   EndCaps and Rings.


   The details and the History of this SDHcal implementation are as follows:

I. The first implementation of the SDHcal in Mokka was made by the LLR
   team and by Emmanuel Latour, following the guidelines from the IPN Lyon
   group and the overall geometry suggested by Henri Videau. The driver
   implementing this first version is SHcal04.

     XIV. New digital Hcal implementation

     Thanks to Emmanuel Latour, a new implementation of Digital Hcal is
     available as sub-detector SHcal04. Only barrel modules are changed,
     the EndCaps and EndCapRings are the same as in previous models.
     A detailed description can be found at:

     Later, this implementation was improved, and the EndCaps and EndCap Rings 
     were filled with RPC's like those in the barrel, except that in the 
     EndCaps and EndCap Rings, the graphite, mylar, PCB, electronics
     and the air layers were modeled by a composite material with the 
     appropriate thickness and density (which is considered to be a good 
     approximation).

     

II. Further improvements of the SDHcal model in Mokka were made available
    in release ' mokka-07-06-p01 ' (February 24, 2011): two new drivers 
    were created, the first following the geometry design from Henri Videau
    (with EndCaps and EndCap rings having the same RPC models like the old
    driver SHcal04), and a second driver having the ' Tesla ' geometry, 
    was written starting from the Analog Hcal and replacing the scintillator
    layers with RPC's:

      I. New driver SHcalRpc01

      Thanks to our collaboration with Ran Han and her collagues from IPN Lyon,
      a new driver implementing the GRPC Hcal was created. It is an improved 
      version of previous driver SHcal04 (that follows the design suggested by 
      Henri Videau): the thickness of the absorber backplate of the EndCaps is 
      now the same as in the Analog Hcal, the numbering of barrel modules is 
      corrected (it takes values from 1 to 5), and there are several changes 
      in the geometry parameters.


      II. New driver SHcalRpc02

      A further contribution of Ran Han and her collagues from IPN Lyon is 
      the new driver SHcalRpc02 that replaces, in the Analog Hcal, the 
      scinillator layers and their associate components with GRPC layers 
      identical to those in the GRPC Hcal.




      At the beginning of June, 2011, this second driver ( SHcalRpc02 ) had 
      several improvements: the replacement in the EndCaps and EndCapRings of 
      Scintillator (and components) with RPCs and their components as they are 
      built in the driver SHcalRpc01 (that follows the geometry suggested by 
      Henri).

      Like in SHcalRpc01, in the EndCaps and Rings there is a layer of thick 
      glass, the gas gap, a layer of thin glasss (these have the same 
      thickneses as those in the Barrel), and the rest is a mixture 
      (electronics, PCB, etc...). There also are no spacers in the EndCaps and 
      Rings.

      The GEAR code was also added to save the thicknesses of the different 
      layers in the EndCap and Rings.
