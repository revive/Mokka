What is new in this Mokka release
=================================

  I. Implementation of services for inner detectors.

 II. Implementation of services for TPC and Ecal for models
     using SDHcal.

III. Bug fix in hit position of SDHcal endcaps.

 IV. Three new detector models were created

  V. Improved Si-Tracking drivers for ILD

=================================

Please note that:

   This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.5 and 9.4 (and 9.4.patch01) and
   CLHEP 2.1.0.1

   It was tested against GEAR v01-01 and LCIO v02-00-03, gcc 3.4.6 and 4.1.2,
   SL4 and SL5.

=================================

  I. Implementation of services for inner detectors.

     New sub_detector tubeX06 is available, which uses the same driver as 
     tubeX05, but has a new DB, tubeX06_14. This DB contains sections made 
     of Al of different thicknesses to model the services that would go
     along the tube (only Al, and no Beryllium for those sections).


 II. Implementation of services for TPC and Ecal for models using SDHcal.

     New driver and sub-detector SServices_02_v00 are available for services 
     (cables, cooling) coming from TPC and Ecal, in the gap between barrel 
     and endcaps, in the model that uses SDHcal. 


III. Bug fix in step position of SDHcal endcaps.

     Thanks to Gerald Grenier and Ran Han, a fix is available for the 
     calculation of Z-coordinate of step position in SDHcal EndCaps.


 IV. Three new detector models were created

     Three new models are available, ILD_O(1,2,3)_v02, based on the _v01
     versions, where the tubeX05 is replaced by the new tubeX06 (mentionned
     above), and in the SDHcal model (ILD_O2_v02) the old services 
     sub_detector is replaced with the new one above (SServices_02_v00).


 V. Improved Si-Tracking drivers for ILD (Aplin, Glattauer)

    - SET_Simple_Planar, SIT_Simple_Planar and FTD_Simple_Staggered now write some
      additional gear parameters needed for reconstruction (strip angle, pitch, etc)

    - added separate hit collections for pixel and strip discs in the FTD_Simple_Staggered

    - added simplified sensor volumes to SIT and SET
